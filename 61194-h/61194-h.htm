<h2>MISS SEAWELL'S BOOKS.</h2>


<h3>THROCKMORTON.</h3></div>


<p class="i2">A novel presenting a strong study of contrasting characters, by an
author intimately acquainted with her scene and background&mdash;the
Virginia of the years immediately following the war. Paper, 50
cents; specially bound in cloth, $1.00.</p>

<p class="p2">"The incidents are of great interest, well-imagined, and admirably carried out.
But the notable feature of the book is the rare charm of its literary expression.
The language is full of grace and wit and delicate sensibility. To read is to be
beguiled."&mdash;<i>New York Sun.</i></p>

<p>"The pages of 'Throckmorton' are alive with picturesque sketches. Its humor
is never forced, and its pathos is never overdone. It is a novel to linger over."&mdash;<i>The
Critic.</i></p>

<p>"A charming story. The author has used good English, and the reader yields
to the fascination of her style."&mdash;<i>The Book Buyer.</i></p>

<p>"There are many quaintly humorous touches, chief among them the terrible
frankness of the delightful old Mrs. Sherrard. The pathos is simple and sincere.
Temple Freke is as real and as fascinating a personage as has sauntered into literature
for many a day. Daring flashes of unconventional common-sense wait to surprise
the reader on dozens of pages."&mdash;<i>Boston Transcript.</i></p>

<p>"Strong in motive, and equally strong in conception and construction. The
author's style is charmingly easy, and the story is altogether delightful."&mdash;<i>Boston
Times.</i></p>

<p>"'Throckmorton' seems to be the product of a writer so rich in resources of
character, motives, and localities, that a restraining hand is ever apparent."&mdash;<i>St. Paul
Pioneer-Press.</i></p>

<p>"Altogether, one of the ablest of the Town and Country Library."&mdash;<i>Montreal
Gazette.</i></p>


<h3>LITTLE JARVIS.</h3>

<p class="i2">The story of the heroic midshipman of the frigate Constellation. The
second of the <i>Youth's Companion</i> prize stories. Illustrated by J. O.
Davidson and George Wharton Edwards. 8vo. Cloth, with specially

Free Press.</i></p>

every reader."&mdash;<i>Boston Home Journal.</i></p>

<h2 id="MARIAN">MAID MARIAN.</h2></div>


<p>Yes, it was surely the embodiment of feminine
beauty&mdash;the dark, narrow-lidded eyes, wide apart&mdash;did
you ever notice the terrible intelligence in
the eyes of a portrait?&mdash;the slim patrician nose,
the hair so quaintly coifed with pearl, the uplifted
hand: no wonder that Macfarren gazed at it with
something like reverence. You will be apt to imagine
that Macfarren was an enthusiast, possibly
with darkly curling hair and of a Byronic-Dantesque
cast of countenance. Quite the contrary. He
was a keen-witted, hard-headed New York lawyer
fast galloping out of his forties&mdash;a well-made, well-dressed
man, with a clear-cut, sensible face. His
hair had been trifled with by the hand of Time,
and what remained is not worth describing.</p>

<p>Nor was the place sanctified by the lady
Marian's portrait a Norman abbey, nor yet a battlemented
castle. It was a room sliced off from
the place where the housemaids kept their brooms
and dust-pans on the third floor of a New York
hotel. Macfarren had kept those rooms for twenty
years. Meanwhile, bachelors' flats had sprung up
all over town, but he was conservative and kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
his modest suite of two rooms until the advent of
the Lady Marian made another room a necessity.
For the portrait was so large&mdash;a full-length&mdash;and
so conspicuous that it would have monopolized
the whole of the cosey sitting-room. Besides,
Macfarren had a&mdash;superstition, perhaps&mdash;something
about the portrait which made him shrink
from exposing it to the vulgar gaze of the waiters
and bell-boys who saw the inside of his room, and
the jokes&mdash;how he would have chafed under them!&mdash;of
the good fellows who came in occasionally
for a quiet smoke and chat.</p>

<p>It seemed as if Destiny had had a share in giving
to him the Lady Marian. Some years before,
loitering in England, he had wandered into King's
Lyndon, an old show-place in one of the midland
counties and had seen this picture. It made a
strange impression on him; and he was singularly
unsusceptible to anything but ideas: they always
impressed him tremendously. He was surprised
and almost ashamed of the hold this face took
upon him. He carried it in his mind through
fifteen years, and once or twice when he had been
arguing a case before a learned judge the sedate,
black figure on the bench had become Lady Marian,
resplendent in white and pearls, and he had experienced
a queer sensation as if he were pleading
his cause to her instead of to the honorable court.
And the other day on a flying trip to London he
had suddenly come across her in an auction-room
where a sale of antiques and curios was going on,
and, with a recklessness entirely foreign to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
natural conservatism, he had bought her at a
high figure&mdash;bought his divinity of fifteen years
for hard cash. He had also hired a room for her,
and, coming home to dinner on this particular
evening, when, for the first time she hung in beauty
on his walls, he entered the place made glorious
by her presence, and, carefully closing the door
after him, stood in homage before her. He had
been smoking, but an instinctive reverence made
him remove his cigar from his lips. He looked
long and steadily. This picture had helped him to
understand himself. Would he have otherwise
known that under this cool exterior, this nature so
distinctly intellectual, existed a sentiment so deep,
so strong, so romantic? It came home to him that
he was very like those old pagans who first took
statues as their symbols and then came to worship
the symbols. Then he looked into the eyes, and
presently the eyes looked at him, loftily, yet not
unkindly. And then&mdash;ah! sweet, strange, delicious
moment&mdash;the lips parted into a dazzling
smile!</p>

<p>Macfarren, moving mechanically like a sleep-walker,
picked up a small lighted lamp from a
table near, although the gas in a gaudy chandelier
flared brightly above him, and examined the picture.
He put the lamp down carefully. He was
a member of the Nineteenth Century Club, and
had heard some queer talk about psychology and
theosophy which had impressed him as being
rather more baseless and extravagant than Jack
and the Bean-stalk. What, then, was this? He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
walked rapidly into the outer sitting-room, locked
the door, and returned. And there, sitting gracefully
upright in a chair, was the Lady Marian.</p>

<p>Something common to worshipers in all ages
happened to Macfarren. He fell on his knees.
Lady Marian seemed in no wise disconcerted, and,
leaning forward, held out her hand. Macfarren
kissed passionately the warm pink palm.</p>

<p>"Friend," said she, in a soft and composed
voice, "how came I hither?"</p>

<p>The question confused Macfarren hopelessly.
He dared not tell her that he had bought her&mdash;that
she came in a box which was opened in the
custom-house, and that he had paid a thirty-per-cent
<i>ad valorem</i> duty on her. He was inexpert as
a liar, although quick at diplomacy. He could
only murmur, after an awkward pause, "I do not
know."</p>

<p>"The last thing I remember," said Marian,
looking around the unfamiliar room with calmly
inquisitive eyes, "was a ball at Kenilworth, whither
I went with Lady Stukely. My Lord of Leicester
told me that our sovereign lady Queen Bess had
signified that she would not excuse me from my
turn of duty as bed-chamber-woman; and then he
drank to my success at court in red wine, and I
drank too. And I was moderate&mdash;I only drank two
small flagons of red wine, a tankard of sack, and
one poor half-gallon of good mulled ale."</p>

<p>Lady Marian uttered this quite composedly,
but to say that Macfarren was completely staggered
is hardly putting it strong enough, particularly as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
she finished up by adding with an air of charming
modesty, "I was too bashful to take more!"</p>

<p>Macfarren gasped as he looked at her, but if
she had told him that she had drank a brewery dry,
it could not have dissolved the instant magic charm
that her grace and beauty had laid softly upon
him. In fact his only comment when the Lady
Marian looked at him inquiringly, as if to ask his
opinion, was&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's little enough, Lady Marian, if one is
thirsty."</p>

<p>This astounding fib did not seem to strike Lady
Marian as a fib at all, and she only asked eagerly:</p>

<p>"Think you the wine was drugged?"</p>

<p>Having entered on his career as a liar, there
was now no retreat for Macfarren. Moreover, he
was really at a loss for opinions, and his only resource
was to lie, promptly, thoroughly, and consistently.</p>

<p>"I think not," he replied, humbly. "A lady of
rank would scarcely be so treated in the house of
her friends, and besides," he added, with the mendacity
of a man in love. "You drank so little&mdash;not
more than a gallon altogether."</p>

<p>Marian's countenance assumed a look of genuine
relief.</p>

<p>"They would hardly dare to play so scurvy a
trick on the daughter of Lord Howard de Winstanley.
And, although I have heard dark tales of
what was done to Amy Robsart&mdash;thou dost know
Amy, the daughter of Sir John Robsart of Cumnor
Hall?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have heard of her," replied Macfarren, and,
his self-possession returning, he added, boldly,
"through Sir Walter Scott of Abbotsford."</p>

<p>"Of what shire, pr'ythee?" asked Marian.</p>

<p>Macfarren had not practiced law at the New
York bar for twenty years without being able to
extricate himself from a tight place. He really
could not recall for the moment what county in
Scotland held Abbotsford, but he replied, at a venture:</p>

<p>"In Perthshire. Have you never heard of Melrose
Abbey, near Jedburgh?"</p>

<p>Marian shook her head and glanced at Macfarren
with something like scorn in her clear eyes.</p>

<p>"I belike me not of the Scotch. It is a false
and treacherous race, they say. They come to
England and tell us they have noble castles and
stately manor-houses in Scotland, and, forsooth,
they are nothing more than hovels and swineherds'
cottages. The Abbotsford of which Sir
Walter told thee is like enough a huntsman's
lodge."</p>

<p>"Indeed it is not," said Macfarren, earnestly.
"It is a magnificent baronial hall. I have been
there myself, and," he added, feeling obliged to
say something in defense of Sir Walter Scott's
character, "Sir Walter is a&mdash;er&mdash;a most respectable
person."</p>

<p>"'Tis likely," replied Lady Marian, half scornfully,
"and this Abbotsford, no doubt, is well furnished
with household stuff he ravaged from English
homes over the border. I think I have heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
of him&mdash;and that he is but little better than a border
ruffian."</p>

<p>Macfarren, seeing it was impossible to rehabilitate
Sir Walter's character, wisely refrained from
further efforts in that direction.</p>

<p>"Thou art an Englishman, I see," she said, after
a moment, "although thy speech is not like that
about King's Lyndon. Mayhap thou art from London.
Thy sober dress makes me think thou art
from the Middle Temple."</p>

<p>This was extremely fortunate for Macfarren,
who feared at every moment she would discover he
was not of noble blood, and that therefore he
should be scorned of her.</p>

<p>"I am a barrister," he answered eagerly.</p>

<p>Marian smiled sweetly: "Some ladies of rank
condemn lawyers for mere clerks and scriveners,
but my father, the Lord Howard de Winstanley,
tells me that at court, Queen Bess doth treat them
like lords and gentlemen&mdash;and, although they rank
not with the nobility, yet are they equal with the
gentry and the churchmen. Hast thou been to
London ever?"</p>

<p>"I was there only three weeks ago," said Macfarren
promptly.</p>

<p>Marian's eyes sparkled. "How doth the queen?
Didst thou go to court? Are the ruffs and fardingales
as huge as ever? How of my Lord Essex,
in Ireland?"</p>

<p>"The queen was very well," said Macfarren.</p>

<p>"Where didst thou see her?" demanded Marian,
before Macfarren, who was about to give her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
an account of the Earl of Essex's adventures in
Ireland, could add a word.</p>

<p>"In&mdash;in Westminster Abbey," said Macfarren
lamely. This was a wretched subterfuge, but it satisfied
Marian, who exclaimed:</p>

<p>"And who attended her? Was it at nooning or
evening service? And has she aged, as much I
fear she hath?"</p>

<p>"She looked just as she has for a long, long
time, ever since I first saw her," said he, desperately.
Clearly, she would ask embarrassing questions.
"But," he added, artfully, "I was not presented
to her, nor did she even honor me with a
glance."</p>

<p>Marian smiled: "Poor queen! her eyesight
doth somewhat fail. But, friend, what is thy name?
and is there no entertainment to be had here?"</p>

<p>Macfarren had never before been ashamed of
his name, but he wished he could have said he was
a Cecil, a Fairfax, a Beauclerk, or any other proud
Elizabethan name. He could only say, with a kind
of proud humility:</p>

<p>"My name is Macfarren, and I and all that is
mine are at your service."</p>

<p>"Well said!" cried Marian. "But tell me,
whose roof doth now shelter me? Whose house is
this?"</p>

<p>"It is an ho&mdash;an inn," answered Macfarren.</p>

<p>"And a good hostelry, I do think," said Marian,
glancing around, "though not like the inns of Suffolk.
But, since thou wast in London lately, we
can not be far from there."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"Only seven days," replied Macfarren, with
nervous audacity.</p>

<p>"But seven days! Then can my father come
for me, if thou wilt send a messenger by post!"</p>

<p>"Indeed I will," responded Macfarren, with a
sinking heart and a guilty conscience as he uttered
this last colossal falsehood.</p>

<p>"And now," said Marian, as if entirely satisfied
with the proposed arrangement, "let us see what
victual mine host can provide. Beshrew me if I
have tasted aught since we dined, at an hour before
noon."</p>

<p>Macfarren looked furtively at his watch. It was
half-past six&mdash;just his dinner-hour. It would be
easy enough to take Marian down to dinner, if he
could get one of the score of pleasant married
women in the hotel with whom he was on friendly
terms to go with her; and, although it is always
awkward to suggest a chaperon to a girl, yet it
must be done.</p>

<p>"We will go to the dining-room immediately.
But I must secure a chaperon for you. That would
be necessary, you know, to prevent talk," said
Macfarren.</p>

<p>"A chaperon?" asked Marian, wonderingly.
"Is it a head-covering, lest the wind should rumple
my coif? Or is it one of the new coaches brought
from France, in which I hear the nobility take the
air?"</p>

<p>"It is neither," answered Macfarren, feeling
anxious that no objection should be made to the
arrangement. "It is a married lady to attend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
you&mdash;" He halted, but Marian took it up at
once.</p>

<p>"A lady-in-waiting, meanest thou? If she is of
suitable rank I shall be well pleased. At King's
Lyndon I had two damsels, daughters of knights,
to wait on my pleasure. Whom wilt have to attend
me?"</p>

<p>Macfarren went through with a rapid mental
calculation. A brilliant idea suddenly came to him.
Mrs. Dietrick Van Tromp, one of the most distinguished
women of New York society, had come
to the hotel for a few days while her Fifth Avenue
mansion was in the hands of the decorators. He
knew her, and knew her weakness for the English
aristocracy. She dearly loved a lord, and, next to
that, any member of a peer's family. So, after an
instant's thought, he responded:</p>

<p>"I'll get Mrs. Dietrick Van Tromp."</p>

<p>Marian seemed anything but struck by the
name.</p>

<p>"And who is Dame Van Tromp?" she demanded,
haughtily.</p>

<p>Macfarren was a brave man, but at that he
quaked. Mrs. Dietrick Van Tromp's husband was
a silent partner in one of the greatest silk-importing
firms in New York, and, although Mrs. Van
Tromp considered the fact that her husband's name
did not appear in the firm-name relieved him from
the stigma of work, yet it would be hard to make
that nice distinction clear to Marian. So, after an
uneasy pause, Macfarren could only blurt out:</p>

<p>"She is the wife of a silk-merchant."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Lady Marian surveyed him with a wide-eyed
amazement, not unmixed with contempt.</p>

<p>"A mercer's wife to attend the daughter of
Lord Howard de Winstanley? Nay, hadst thou
not better call the kitchen scullion to keep her
company? Friend, I like thee well, but I fear thou
art a stranger to good company."</p>

<p>Macfarren, thoroughly abashed, remained silent,
while a burning blush came to his face. The unmerited
scorn of this lovely girl was hard to bear.</p>

<p>"Dost thou not know some one of rank to keep
me company?" she asked, presently, with some
petulance.</p>

<p>Macfarren ran hastily over in his mind a half-dozen
names of the wives of titled and untitled
Englishmen then in New York whom he had met in
society. No, none of them would do; and, besides,
he could not take the liberty.</p>

<p>"Dear lady," he said, after an embarrassed
pause, "I myself am a commoner. I have no title
except that of a gentleman and an honest man. I
can not stoop to ask favors of those with whom my
acquaintance is but slight. I offer you the protection
of people like myself. You will not want for
respect among them."</p>

<p>At this Marian jumped up with the greatest animation.
"Now, by my faith, I see thou art truly a
gentleman, no matter what thy birth may be; for
birth is but an accident. But honor, wisdom, and
valor are no accidents. Nor is that noble science,
the art of being a gentleman, an accident, and,
although I will not go with the mercer's wife, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
will I go alone with thee&mdash;for I see thou art both
learned and polite; and look you, friend, for all
that I value my place, I esteem honor, wisdom, and
valor more than anything else in the world." And
then, laughing, she added, "Hunger doth pinch me,
and thou must take me quickly to the banqueting-hall
to appease this gnawing."</p>

<p>Macfarren smiled too. A nature so noble as
hers could easily cast aside the fetters of conventional
rank. She evidently believed in the great
republic of merit, although she could not formulate
her belief. She rose and moved gracefully forward
to the door which Macfarren held open respectfully
for her. As she passed by him into the clearer
light of the little drawing-room and the brilliant
corridor beyond, he received a kind of electric
shock at her extreme loveliness. She wore a trailing
gown of brocaded satin, and her long hanging
sleeves were lined with crimson velvet and trimmed
with swan's-down. A mighty ruff encircled her
neck, and her hair was curiously arranged with
pearls. Her slender hands were crossed before her.
As she stepped out in the hall she noticed the carpet,
which had escaped her observation before.
She started back.</p>

<p>"What! dost thou lay fine cloths upon the floor
instead of rushes? I would like to have a gown of
this rich stuff when I go to court. Canst thou not
buy me enough for a train, or even a petticoat?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, with pleasure," said Macfarren.</p>

<p>"But will it not cost a prince's ransom?" cried
Marian, anxiously, stooping down and picking up a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
small rug that lay before the door. "Think how
my lady Stukely would fume if she saw me with a
petticoat of this queenly stuff."</p>

<p>She held the rug up before her in admiration,
but, as if suddenly ashamed of her childishness,
dropped it and walked rapidly down the corridor,
Macfarren keeping at her side. Macfarren knew
but little of the dress of women, and, having seen
many startling costumes in New York society of late
years, flattered himself that his companion's guise
was not much out of the ordinary run. But his
illusion vanished when Mrs. Dietrick Van Tromp
swept out, gorgeous in dinner-dress, from a door
opening on the corridor. He saw at once that she
was stricken with surprise, and, as she bowed to him,
her eyes asked, expressively:</p>

<p>"Who is she?"</p>

<p>Nor was Marian one whit less impressed with
the descendant of the Knickerbockers. She gave
one comprehensive glance of admiration, and whispered
hurriedly to Macfarren:</p>

<p>"What noble dame is that?"</p>

<p>Macfarren felt a certain malicious pleasure as
he answered, <i>sotto voce</i>:</p>

<p>"That is Mrs. Dietrick Van Tromp, the lady
who I suggested should attend you to the table."</p>

<p>Marian's countenance changed to one of angry
and amazed disgust.</p>

<p>"If mercers' wives dress thus, how can they be
told from queens and princesses?" she inquired,
haughtily.</p>

<p>"They can't," responded Macfarren, "except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
that queens and princesses are usually much less
toploftical."</p>

<p>"But," demanded Marian, "are there not sumptuary
laws that forbid the daughters of tradesmen
and merchants from wearing stuffs reserved for the
nobility and gentry?"</p>

<p>"There has been a very strong effort to pass
sumptuary laws in Ohio and Georgia and Maine
and Kansas, but they have generally proved inoperative,"
answered Macfarren. Seeing, however, his
companion's puzzled look, he hastened forward and
said, "Ah! there is the elevator."</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Tromp had preceded them, and stood
by the door. As Marian and Macfarren approached,
the former gave her a look of unmistakable disdain,
which, to Macfarren's horror, was supplemented by
a command given in a clear and self-possessed
voice:</p>

<p>"Give place, madam."</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Tromp made no reply, but glanced,
stupefied for a moment, at Macfarren, who turned
pale and then red. A flush rose to her face, and,
without replying, she turned half around from
Marian and rang the bell again.</p>

<p>The elevator then appeared at the top of the
opening, and slowly descended.</p>

<p>Marian's look of scorn and disdain gradually
changed to one of genuine alarm. She clutched
Macfarren nervously by the arm. Her breath came
in short, quick gasps, and as the elevator boy threw
the sliding door open she almost shrieked. Mrs.
Van Tromp, without noticing either Macfarren or his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
companion, calm as if nothing out of the common
run had occurred, stepped in and began coolly arranging
a stray lock of her hair before the mirrors
with which the elevator was lined. The boy waited,
the rope in his hand, looking impatiently at Macfarren.
A lucky idea flew into Macfarren's mind.</p>

<p>"If you don't get in, she'll think you are afraid,"
he whispered.</p>

<p>The effect was magical. Marian raised her lovely,
proud head and stepped gingerly in, the boy
shut the door with a loud whack, and, with a vicious
pull at the rope, they began to descend. Macfarren
saw, however, by the tightly compressed lips and
the hands fiercely clinched to prevent their trembling,
that Marian was suffering all the tortures of
a proud soul in a paroxysm of fear. Surreptitiously
he saw her make the sign of the cross on her
breast. He dared not address Mrs. Van Tromp,
who, though blandness itself in her air and countenance,
yet, indicated dangerous possibilities; so
to all three the ride was uncomfortable and the atmosphere
surcharged with electricity.</p>

<p>The elevator stopped at the door of the dining-room.
This opened on a broad, square corridor, red-carpeted,
the lofty ceiling and walls elaborately frescoed.
The dining-room itself was a noble apartment,
seating five hundred persons, blazing from end to
end with crystal chandeliers which were reflected
in great mirrors placed at intervals. It was full of
that subtile flavor of luxury peculiar to the best
American hotels. The broad doorway, with its
folding leaves wide open, was guarded by a mag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>nificent
person who looked like a major-general in
plain clothes, but who was really the head waiter;
and from within this huge doorway poured a flood
of warm light, of soft chatter, of delicious and enticing
odors.</p>

<p>But here a terrible development seemed likely
to occur. Mrs. Van Tromp, with a slight and supercilious
inclination of her head, was about to
step out, as the elevator-boy flung the door open
with a bang.</p>

<p>But Marian was too adroit for her. With an
indescribably quick and graceful motion she too
made for the door. The elevator-boy, with a delighted
grin, gave way for the two ladies. He hoped
to witness one of those feminine wrangles which
sometimes vary the monotony of hotel life. The
two ladies stood up boldly facing each other.
Marian spoke first.</p>

<p>"Madam, what may your name be?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Tromp paused for a moment. Should
she reply to her or not? But a glance at the
beauty and undeniable elegance of the new-comer,
and a knowledge of Macfarren's position in the
world, seemed to determine that the enemy before
her was worthy of her steel. So she replied, in her
stateliest manner:</p>

<p>"I am not aware of any obligation that I am
under to tell you my name; but, if it affords you
any peculiar pleasure, I will say that I am Mrs.
Dietrick Van Tromp. Now, will you be good
enough to let me pass?"</p>

<p>"Nay, are you not a silk-merchant's wife,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
madam?" asked Marian, holding her ground
stoutly.</p>

<p>An angry blush rose to Mrs. Van Tromp's
cheek. This was clearly unendurable.</p>

<p>"I am. Nor have I ever had occasion to blush
for any of my husband's commercial transactions;
and I insist" (in the tone of "I command") "that
you let me pass."</p>

<p>"Let you pass before the daughter of Lord
Howard de Winstanley? Madam, if even for the
sake of blessed peace I let you pass, would I not
do my lineage wrong, my order wrong? Is not the
law of precedence well fixed? Good lack! when
peddlers' wives take the way of peers' daughters,
then will there be fine coil."</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Tromp started back as if she had been
shot. She turned to Macfarren with a look which
said, "Explain." Macfarren saw the road to peace
open.</p>

<p>"May I present to you the Lady Marian de Winstanley,
of King's Lyndon, in Suffolk?" Feeling
obliged to say something more, he added, "The
Lady Marian is unused to our methods, and&mdash;a&mdash;does
not fully&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Mrs. Van Tromp relieved him of the embarrassment
of proceeding further. She held out her
hand to Marian with a brilliant smile. "How am I
to apologize?" she said. "I didn't comprehend.
How rude you must have thought me! Of course
Lady Marian could not be expected to understand
our methods."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Marian, with beautiful condescen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>sion,
"although our ways differ, I make no doubt
that humble folk have as many sterling virtues as
the nobility and gentry."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Van Tromp, thinking her new
acquaintance's remark included herself, Mrs. Van
Tromp, among the gentry anyhow. "Of course we
are very new, and society, outside of a small set in
New York and a few families at Newport, is crude.
Fortunately, here we have an old Knickerbocker
circle&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Knicker&mdash;what?" asked Lady Marian, somewhat
saucily.</p>

<p>"Bocker," answered Mrs. Van Tromp, affably.
"Knickerbocker: The old Dutch families. We
try to keep to ourselves as much as possible&mdash;and
we have the AssociationofcolonialdamesthedaughtersoftheAmericanrevolution&mdash;"
Mrs. Van
Tromp rattled this and several other names off
volubly, although she had heretofore maintained a
carefully acquired English slowness of speech, and
wound up with&mdash;</p>

<p>"But unluckily, we have no hereditary nobility."</p>

<p>"Yet," responded Marian, "you do ape us wonderfully
well. I have not seen many mercers' wives
who looked the noble dame like you."</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Tromp did not know whether to be
pleased or not with this remark; but it is hard to
fall out with peers' daughters, and, besides, from
Lady Marian's occasional use of "thee" and
"thou" she rashly assumed that she was one of
the dozen or so members of the society of Friends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
in the English Peerage, and she knew plain speaking
was a characteristic of the Friends. So she
only laughed brightly and said:</p>

<p>"You'll certainly take the <i>pas</i> now."</p>

<p>Lady Marian, nothing loath, stepped out of the
elevator.</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Tromp turned to whisper to Macfarren,
"So charming! So unique! I declare, I knew
her to be a person of high rank the very moment
I saw her. And wasn't it kind of her to excuse
my rudeness? Pray add your apologies to
mine."</p>

<p>Macfarren, with a sardonic grin, agreed.</p>

<p>They were now standing in the corridor. A
dozen or more men were passing back and forth,
giving their hats and coats to the young man who
presided over the shelf-like arrangement of such
articles, stopping to chat with one another, and all
gazing with unfeigned admiration at Macfarren's
companion. He nodded to them carelessly, while
Mrs. Van Tromp carefully avoided seeing them,
especially those who came suspiciously near her.
She meant to monopolize this precious scion of the
nobility herself. Already before her delighted vision
came the dream of a visit to King's Lyndon, and
the charms of her next season in London. Four
times had she crossed the ocean in vain, and never
had she been able to get presented at court; but
this lucky accident might do the whole business for
her.</p>

<p>"My friend," said Marian, turning to Macfarren,
"I would not thou shouldst think me fearful,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>my
grandsire drew a mighty bow at Bosworth Field,
and none of my race have a drop of craven blood,&mdash;but
I feared me yon contrivance was something
supernatural. Tell me, was there anything of the
black art in it? I made me the sign of the cross,
that doth keep devils at bay; but the thing I saw
was marvelous."</p>

<p>"It is perfectly right," said Macfarren, glad to
relieve her. "It was all done with a rope and
pulley. But let us go in to dinner."</p>

<p>"Thou shalt walk by my side," said Marian to
Mrs. Van Tromp. "Thou seest I am not always
the proud creature thou took'st me for."</p>

<p>The association with the great had its disadvantages,
thought Mrs. Van Tromp as she accepted
this gracious condescension, but its advantages
were too obvious to be overlooked. So, with much
satisfaction, she supported Marian on the left,
while Macfarren walked by her on the right. Marian
took an opportunity to whisper to Macfarren,
"I tolerate her only for your sake," in a tone
which made him thrill with delight.</p>

<p>At the doorway the head-waiter saluted them
with a profound bow. Marian stopped short, and,
carefully disposing of her train, made in return a
courtesy so deep and so graceful that every eye
was turned on her. As they passed on, she said,
"I know neither the name nor the rank of the
person I courtesied to, but I am sure he hath an
air of breeding."</p>

<p>When they entered the room everybody's attention
was fixed upon them. Marian bore the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
scrutiny with perfect composure. Like all truly
beautiful women, she seemed superbly unconscious
of it, and, as she swept with majestic grace toward
the upper part of the room, Macfarren glowed
with pride at presenting so much dignity and loveliness
to an admiring world. When they reached
Mrs. Van Tromp's table, that lady gave unmistakable
signs of a willingness to leave her own
table for the privilege of dining with Lady Marian
and Macfarren; but Macfarren, albeit the most
courteous of men, had a fund of polite resolution
that had more than once brought Mrs. Van Tromp
and other grand dames to bay. He meant to have
a <i>tête-à-tête</i> with Marian: so, with consummate tact,
he managed to leave Mrs. Van Tromp in the lurch
and to take his seat with Marian at a table at the
very top of the room. He had a design in this
which quickly bore fruit. Marian remarked with
pleasure that the top of the room was given her
without dissent. There was no one at the table
except themselves.</p>

<p>When they were seated, and the waiter had
handed them each a <i>menu</i> card, Macfarren observed
that Marian was deeply puzzled by hers.</p>

<p>"What may this mean?" she asked. "It is
not English, nor French, nor Latin, although it
doth somewhat resemble all three. Or is it," she
asked, archly, "a madrigal writ in my honor?"</p>

<p>"No," said Macfarren, smiling; "although, if
one could write at all, one might be inspired by
such a theme."</p>

<p>It was an old, old compliment, but it was evi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>dently
new to Marian, who smiled, and said, "Thou
hast a dainty wit."</p>

<p>Macfarren concluded not to trouble her about
the <i>menu</i>, as she probably knew nothing about it:
so he beckoned to the waiter, and said, "Turtle-soup
for both." The waiter vanished.</p>

<p>Marian had not ceased to gaze about her with
an air of surprised admiration.</p>

<p>"Never saw I so fine an hostelry before," said
she. "Art thou not deceiving me, and is not this
the house of some feudal prince?"</p>

<p>"Indeed it is not," replied Macfarren, earnestly.
"It is nothing but an inn, I assure you."</p>

<p>"And all these gayly-costumed people&mdash;are
they not persons of consideration?"</p>

<p>"Some of them are," answered Macfarren, "but
most of them are merchants and traders."</p>

<p>Just then the waiter brought a tiny silver-plated
tureen of soup and set it down before them.
At that moment Macfarren caught sight of Mrs.
Van Tromp at the next table but one, who smiled
coquettishly at him and held up a glass of red
wine in expressive pantomime. But, while he was
watching her, he saw a sudden change come over
her face&mdash;a look of paralyzed astonishment: she
sat, her hand holding the wineglass suspended in
the air, a silhouette, motionless against the background,
and rigid with amazement. Macfarren
turned to his companion, and saw at once. Marian
had raised the tureen to her dainty mouth, and
was drinking the turtle-soup without the formality
of a soup-plate or a tablespoon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Macfarren was of a nature too loyal to see
anything to excite mirth in this unexpected breach
of custom in the woman he had loved for fifteen
years: he only felt a blind and furious anger
against those who might make her a subject of
ridicule. Marian, however, had no suspicion of
what was passing in his mind, but, after draining
the tureen, set it down with a sigh of satisfaction,
saying, "By my faith, that was a royal dish of
broth."</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Tromp's horrified amazement was
bad enough, but when Macfarren turned and saw
James, his waiter for ten years, heretofore a model
of gravity and discreetness, with his mouth stretched
from ear to ear convulsed with silent laughter, he
could scarcely refrain from braining him with the
water-decanter before him. In an instant James
saw the dangerous look in Macfarren's eye, and,
as if by magic, his countenance assumed its look
of wonted stolidity, but not until Macfarren had
hissed at him, in an aside, "Confound your infernal
insolence, if you smile again I'll break every bone
in your rascally body." James was an arrant
coward, and not a tremor appeared upon the
placid surface of his countenance during the rest
of the dinner&mdash;not even when he handed Macfarren
a card from Mrs. Van Tromp, on which was
scrawled, "<i>Quite unconventional, but so high-bred.</i>"</p>

<p>Then came the ordering of the dinner. Macfarren,
without consulting his <i>vis-à-vis</i>, did it all.
He did not bother with the <i>entrées</i>, but required
plain roast beef, potatoes, and plum-pudding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Meanwhile Marian continued to gaze around
with delight. Macfarren felt at every moment the
subtile charm of her exquisite womanhood. Understanding
as he did the reason of her peculiar ignorance
of every-day matters, nothing she did
shocked him. Marian talked gayly and unreservedly,
and promised him a wild boar's head for his
Christmas dinner if he came to King's Lyndon.
"And, though they may want to place thee with
the clerks and the chaplain," she said, smiling, "I
will have thee above the salt with me, for I see
thou hast the heart and soul as well as the manners
of a gentleman."</p>

<p>In a few minutes the simple dinner ordered by
Macfarren came. Marian's eyes glistened as they
rested on the roast beef. "That came from a goodly
baron of roast beef; but where is the ale wherewith
to wash it down?" she asked.</p>

<p>Macfarren, with a terrible recollection of Marian's
performances in the ale-drinking line, hastily
took up the wine-list, marked off two bottles of
Bass's ale, and handed it to the obsequious James,
who disappeared and in a few moments returned
with it. He fetched glasses with a flourish, and,
drawing the cork, the creamy flood poured into the
tumbler at Marian's plate. This, however, did not
seem to please Marian. Looking around, she saw
near by a pitcher. "Bring me yon tankard," she
said to James. James, warned by the light in Macfarren's
eye, brought the pitcher. Marian, quietly
pouring all of the ale in her glass, and all left in
the bottle, into the pitcher, James in a twinkling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
opened the other bottle and poured it in also, when,
lifting the pitcher as she had done the tureen of
soup to her rosy lips, she drank the quart of ale in
a single breath.</p>

<p>Macfarren's agony of pity was painful to him.
The idea that she would be laughed at inspired
him with frenzy. Yet, having perfect self-control,
he gave no outward indication of the tumult within
him, and managed to say in quite his ordinary
voice to Marian, "Won't you let me give you some
of this roast beef?"</p>

<p>"In faith I will," responded Marian, with alacrity,
and, reaching over, she picked up a large slice
of rare beef in her fingers and began munching it
with much enjoyment. Macfarren was past being
flustered then.</p>

<p>"Won't you have some potatoes?" he asked,
politely.</p>

<p>"Some&mdash;what didst thou say?"</p>

<p>"Potatoes. Just try some."</p>

<p>"What strange stuff is that? Will it not give
me a palsy, or the falling sickness? Methinks I
have heard they were poisonous."</p>

<p>"They are excellent and very wholesome," said
Macfarren, helping her, and gently thrusting a fork
into her hand. "Sir Walter Raleigh brought them
from&mdash;from&mdash;" he felt a strange hesitation at saying
the word "America."</p>

<p>"Then will I try them," said Marian, dropping
the fork and taking a spoon. "Dost thou know
Sir Walter?" asked she, while busily engaged in
munching the beef and ladling up the potatoes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
"I know all about him," said Macfarren.</p>

<p>"And my Lord Cecil of Burleigh?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. A very great man. Sir Walter I
take to be one of the noblest characters of the
reign of Queen Bess."</p>

<p>"Then," said Lady Marian, bridling, and laying
down her spoon, "thou must have strange notions
of loyalty. Sir Walter is a dangerous man; and if
the queen should let him out from the Tower,
where he now languishes in just punishment for
his crimes, the realm will rue it. He hath dealings
with the devil, hath Sir Walter."</p>

<p>A sudden idea came to Macfarren. "Have you
ever heard," he asked, eagerly, "of a maker of
plays at the Globe Theatre, in Blackfriars&mdash;one
William Shakespeare?"</p>

<p>"I have heard of him," carelessly replied Marian&mdash;"an
indifferent good player. Our lady the
queen hath taken some small notice of him. For
my part, I wonder she should trouble about a beggarly
strolling play-actor like this Jack Shakespeare.
Now, Ben Jonson hath writ good plays,
and he is of better birth and breeding than Tom
Shakespeare&mdash;or Jack, or what you will."</p>

<p>The depth of Macfarren's infatuation may be
judged when he let this speech pass unchallenged.</p>

<p>Although Marian ate heartily, yet the dinner
was comparatively short, and Macfarren had no
idea of ordering any dessert but the pudding. Before
he knew it, however, the table had been
cleared, and James had placed before them not
only plum-pudding, but a strawberry ice and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
dish of nuts and raisins. Lady Marian attacked
the nuts first, cracking them between her small
strong white teeth like a squirrel, and then said to
Macfarren, "Lend me thy dagger for the pudding."
Macfarren gazed at her stupidly. "Hast not thou
a dagger?" she asked, impatiently. "These pointless
blades I see here can cut nothing. Feel in thy
belt."</p>

<p>Mechanically Macfarren put his hand in his
pocket, and, drawing out his penknife, opened the
largest blade, and handed it to her. This seemed
to pacify Marian, who with the assistance of her
fingers, speedily disposed of the pudding.</p>

<p>Then came the strawberry ice. With a silent
but dreadful apprehension Macfarren watched her,
and when something between a shriek and a groan
pierced the air, he was the only person in the dining-room
who was not surprised. Marian had
gulped down half the plateful at once. Clapping
her hands to her face, she rocked back and forth
in her chair, evidently suffering agony. Several
ladies half rose from their chairs; the head-waiter
rushed forward; but Mrs. Van Tromp was already
on the spot, holding Marian's hands.</p>

<p>"Dear Lady Marian, tell us what it is," she
asked, in soothing tones.</p>

<p>"I know not," said Marian, faintly. "I think
it must have been that evil stuff called potatoes.
As soon as I had swallowed it I felt a giddiness,
my head whirled, and I have heard it hath subtle
and dangerous qualities."</p>

<p>"It couldn't have been the potatoes, do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
think?" said Mrs. Van Tromp. "Perhaps it was
the ale."</p>

<p>"Thou art a fool," responded Marian, tartly.
"Dost thou think a Howard de Winstanley so lily-livered
that one poor beaker of ale&mdash;and weak at
that&mdash;could do this mischief?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Tromp was considerably nettled by
this speech, but the name Howard de Winstanley
had not lost its magic.</p>

<p>"Let us get out of here," said Macfarren, hurriedly;
and, Marian rising, he offered her his arm,
and, with Mrs. Van Tromp on the other side, they
went out of the dining-room as they had entered
it, and, as before, were the cynosure of all eyes.</p>

<p>When they reached the corridor, Macfarren
realized that he must have a little while to think
before taking another step. What to do with his
fair <i>protégée</i> was troubling him excessively; and so,
to gain at least a few minutes' time, he proposed
that they should enter a little alcove at the end of
the main hall, where a tiny fire crackled cheerfully.
So he led the way, and Marian sank on the luxurious
sofa, while Mrs. Van Tromp drew up a chair,
and, spreading wide her gorgeous fan of peacocks'
feathers, settled herself to hear all about King's
Lyndon.</p>

<p>"Now do tell us about your lovely place in
Suffolk. I am very fond of those old English
places. The last time we were in England we
spent a delightful week at Fairlight, Sir Herbert
Cheevor's place in Suffolk. It was charming&mdash;no
Americans except ourselves."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
This last was the most charming part of it to
Mrs. Van Tromp.</p>

<p>"I know Fairlight well," replied Marian; "although
it has been some years since I was there.
But the Cheevors&mdash;what Cheevors? It is the
manor house of the Shadwells."</p>

<p>"Yes, a good many years ago; but&mdash;"</p>

<p>Macfarren here, seeing trouble ahead, cut in
dexterously by a sly jog of Mrs. Van Tromp's elbow,
by which she dropped her fan, and, with a
thousand apologies for his awkwardness, he picked
it up. The ruse succeeded, temporarily.</p>

<p>"I'm sure you'll like it here," continued Mrs.
Van Tromp, "so many English are here this winter.
There's quite a little colony on Staten Island. Of
course you'll be invited to the F. C. D. C's and the
Patriarchs and Matriarchs?"</p>

<p>Marian, without answering, turned two wondering
eyes on Macfarren. Him at least she could
understand.</p>

<p>"They are balls and banquets," he explained.</p>

<p>Marian turned to Mrs. Van Tromp. "I can not
go except my father, the Lord Howard de Winstanley,
go with me, or else my lady Stukely," she said.</p>

<p>"Oh, there won't be any trouble about that. I
will see that your father and Lady Stukely get
cards," responded Mrs. Van Tromp, eagerly.</p>

<p>Here was a go, indeed&mdash;taking Lord Howard
de Winstanley and Lady Marian de Winstanley and
Lady Stukely all to the Matriarchs under her
wing! What a happy woman then was Mrs. Van
Tromp!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
But if the mention of these magic names filled
the descendant of the Knickerbockers with rapture,
what were her blissful feelings when Lady
Marian said gravely:</p>

<p>"I am bed-chamber woman to the queen, and
she hath got so vexatious in her old age, that I
know not if she will excuse either my poor self or
Lady Stukely from court, even for a day."</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Tromp, although a matron of the
strictest propriety could at that instant have embraced
Macfarren for having introduced her to
Lady Marian. Macfarren, in spite of the strange
and <i>risqué</i> position in which he found himself and
the woman he most honored in the world, could
scarcely keep his countenance. Mrs. Van Tromp's
expressive face, sparkling with pleasure, was in
striking contrast to Lady Marian's statuesque calm.</p>

<p>"Now, pray, tell us something about the queen,"
kept on Mrs. Van Tromp. "We all take such an
interest in everything relating to her&mdash;such a
model woman in every respect."</p>

<p>"Is she?" dryly remarked Marian. "I know
she hath a heavy hand. See you this ear of mine?
Well, one day, as I was in her closet, handing her
her petticoat, I happened to glance sidewise out
of the window at my Lord Essex in the court-yard,
and the queen fetched me such a box on the ear, it
stings me yet, and called me a lazy vixen, with eyes
for none but cavaliers, and if I did not behave myself
better she would pack me off home. And being
vexed and sore, I did complain to my Lord Bishop
of London, who told me he could do nothing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
help me, for the queen had sworn at him like any
trooper as he stood in his bishop's robes, and had
kicked and cuffed him most cruelly."</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Tromp's countenance was a study
during all this. She finally murmured faintly:</p>

<p>"I'd no idea the queen was that sort of a
person."</p>

<p>"And," continued Lady Marian, animated by
the recital of her wrongs at the queen's hands,
"she doth wear apparel too young for her years,
and paints her face, albeit she be near seventy.
And dances&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dances!" said Mrs. Van Tromp, almost
breathless with surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes," promptly answered Lady Marian, getting
up with alacrity, "not a stately measure like
this&mdash;"</p>

<p>And here, she walked with matchless grace, a
few steps of a courtly dance.</p>

<p>"But a hoydenish thing like this&mdash;"</p>

<p>Throwing her train over her arm, Lady Marian
executed a <i>pas de seul</i> that would have done credit
to any ballet girl in the world. Her heels flew up
and her toes flew out, her skirts whirled wildly
about, and she was a perfect picture of grace and
<i>abandon</i>.</p>

<p>To a man of Macfarren's nature, who had a
tender respect for all women, this exhibition, however
graceful, could not but be painful. But when
the woman in the case was the one dearest to him
in the whole world, the pain became agony. But
far was it from Mrs. Van Tromp to be shocked at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
any performance of Lady Marian de Winstanley,
bed-chamber woman to the queen.</p>

<p>"Is that the queen's favorite dance?" she cried.
"Then, dear Lady Marian, may I ask you to teach
me a few steps of it."</p>

<p>And the first thing Macfarren saw, Mrs. Van
Tromp's train was over her arm and she was capering
about as furiously as Lady Marian.</p>

<p>Now, although Macfarren was suffering the
tortures of the damned, in addition to which he
momentarily expected the angry interference of
the proprietor, and to have the misery of seeing
Lady Marian thrust disgracefully out of the hotel,
the spectacle of Mrs. Van Tromp as an elderly
Bacchante was too much for him. He lay back in
his chair and laughed until he thought he should
have died. A cow trying to walk a tight rope
would have been graceful compared to Mrs. Van
Tromp's elephantine attempts&mdash;but when with a
final hop, skip and a jump, she asked him what he
thought of it, he lied desperately.</p>

<p>"Beautiful&mdash;beautiful!" he cried, "you'll make
a sensation, sure&mdash;and Van Tromp will get a divorce,"
he added mentally.</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Tromp and Lady Marian, each exhausted
by the exercise, sat down panting&mdash;and
Macfarren drew a long breath of relief when the
show was over.</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Tromp, after fanning herself for a
moment turned to Lady Marian and asked:</p>

<p>"Were you ill coming over in the steamer?"</p>

<p>"What?" inquired Marian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Van Tromp repeated her question, adding,
"I always feel every revolution of the screw myself."</p>

<p>"What means she?" asked Marian of Macfarren.
"Steamer&mdash;screw&mdash;what are they? I never saw
them in Suffolk, or Norfolk either."</p>

<p>Macfarren felt perfectly helpless. How could
he explain it to her? For the first time he floundered.</p>

<p>"Steam, you know," he said, blunderingly,&mdash;"the
steam that comes out of a teakettle&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," interrupted Mrs. Van Tromp, who had
not exactly taken in what Marian had said.
"Doesn't it seem strange that it should propel a
ship three hundred miles a day across the ocean?
Dear me!"</p>

<p>"The steam from a teakettle propel a ship three
hundred miles a day! Madam, either thou art
grossly deceived, or else thou&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But perhaps you came over in a yacht," cried
Mrs. Van Tromp, thinking the lady Marian unused
to the records of the Cunarders and White Star
ships, in which passengers are so profoundly interested.
"Of course on a yacht it is quite different,
you know. There isn't any object in covering so
many miles a day. But I must say I like fast traveling.
The slowest time we ever made in crossing
was two hundred miles a day, and we were out
nearly fourteen days."</p>

<p>"But the steam from the teakettle&mdash;and two
hundred miles a day? Did I hear aright?" asked
Marian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"You certainly did," said Mrs. Van Tromp,
with a heightened color.</p>

<p>"Then, madam," said Lady Marian, rising majestically,
"I can only say that such crazy tales
reflect neither grace nor credit on you, and if you
be not taken for one who loves marvels more than
truth it will much surprise me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Tromp rose too. She hated to give
up taking Lady Marian and her father and Lady
Stukely to the Matriarchs, but there were some
things she could not stand.</p>

<p>"I am sure," she said, speaking in a tone of lofty
dignity, but fluttering her fan with some agitation,
"that you do not mean to imply that I say what is
false; but your language is at least open to that
inference."</p>

<p>"Madam," replied Marian, with equal haughtiness,
"my language and your inference are one.
And that thou thinkest me a poor credulous fool
adds not one whit to the good will I owe thee.
This comes," she continued, with severe displeasure,
"of mercers' wives playing lady."</p>

<p>Macfarren's position during this colloquy was
awkward in the extreme. He had been blest in
always seeing women in their gracious and lovable
aspect, and now with these two ladies, each a
queen in her own realm, facing each other, crimson
and defiant, himself responsible for their meeting,
the situation was anything but agreeable to his fastidious
nature. But it need scarcely be said that
his sympathies were all with Marian. Unconsciously
she had been the aggressor; but how un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>just
to judge her by that stricter code of manners
that governed Mrs. Van Tromp! How proud the
young girl looked, serene in her consciousness of
rank and position! How like an angry fish-wife
looked Mrs. Van Tromp! And what was he to say
or do? Obviously, nothing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Van Tromp made the next move. She
was furiously vexed, but, being at the core a very
shrewd woman, she did not intend to close every
chink of reconciliation. The Lady Marian was certainly
a very queer person, and this might be only
one of her numerous peculiarities; but she was the
daughter of Lord Howard de Winstanley and chaperoned
by Lady Stukely. So, making a low bow,
she said:</p>

<p>"I am sorry that this should have occurred. I
feel myself blameless, though; and when Lady Marian
de Winstanley makes the apology she owes
me, and which she also owes herself, I shall be glad
to forget that it has ever happened."</p>

<p>But, before she could sail gracefully off, the
Lady Marian had started up, and, seizing Macfarren
by the arm nervously, cried out, in a voice full of
distress:</p>

<p>"Let us return to your lodgings. I am better
there than elsewhere in this strange inn, and there
I will remain alone with thee the seven days thou
sayest it will take for my father to reach me."</p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Van Tromp!</p>

<p>In moments of great excitement all kinds and
classes of people are apt to fall into the same
homely idiomatic language. Therefore Mrs. Van<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Tromp said, or rather shouted, at this terrible instant,
"The brazen hussy!" and with one fierce
scowl that took in both Macfarren and the Lady
Marian, and with a wild rustle of draperies, she
flew down the corridor, the swish-swish of her
trained dress sounding like the flapping wings of a
frightened domestic fowl.</p>

<p>"You've done it now," was Macfarren's involuntary
exclamation; but he was too loyal to his
new-found love to let any other word escape him.
There was nothing for him but to take her back to
his apartments, call up the proprietor, and settle
upon some temporary plan for the protection of
this solitary and beautiful young creature. "Come,"
said he, leading the way.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Marian, as they walked rapidly
down the long, narrow, red-carpeted hall, "I was
hasty with the mercer's wife; but the low-bred
creature did vex me with her lies. But I think she
hath not all her wits about her. Didst thou not
observe the strange ways of speech she had?" tapping
her forehead significantly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Macfarren; "but here is the
door." He opened it, and ushered her into his little
drawing-room as if she had been a queen. Marian
turned and locked the door behind them. "To
keep the mad woman out," she explained.</p>

<p>Macfarren led her to a sofa. "Now," said he,
"let us determine upon your immediate future.
Rest assured, all that reverence and the tenderest
respect can do for you shall be done."</p>

<p>"I believe thee," answered Marian, turning her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
large clear gaze upon him. "I know not who nor
what thou art, but this: thou art a gentleman; and
that is enough."</p>

<p>Macfarren bowed to the ground.</p>

<p>"But it seems plain to me," she continued.
"London, thou sayest, is but seven days from here
by land."</p>

<p>"By land and water," corrected Macfarren.</p>

<p>"Well, it matters not," she said, impatiently,
"so it be seven days. My father is there, and will
quickly send a trusty person after me. Now, tell
me, friend, who are the persons of chief consideration
in this town?"</p>

<p>Macfarren stopped to think a moment. He
answered, not according to his own conviction, but
merely by the general estimate: "The&mdash;the&mdash;Vanderbilts
and the Astors, I presume."</p>

<p>"Who are they?" demanded Marian.</p>

<p>"Rich merchants," responded Macfarren.</p>

<p>"That will do then," said Marian, decisively.
"This, then, is my plan. I will go to the house of
the first thou didst name. No doubt they will be
pleased to entertain a daughter of the house of
Winstanley. I will crave their hospitality until my
father doth send or come; and in leaving I will
present them with this string of pearls, which will
do doubt delight their honest hearts, unused to the
gold and glitter of the great. Thou shalt take me;
so get thy sword and mantle and come."</p>

<p>She was evidently determined; but at that moment
a tremendous knocking came at the door.
"Open! open!" he heard half a dozen voices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
shout, and "Murder!" He recognized the voices.
There was the loud basso of the proprietor and
the weak treble of the room-clerk, and there was
Marsden, his particular chum, and Smithers, the
greatest gossip of the hotel smoking-room, all bellowing
in chorus, and the door must yield soon. A
cold horror seized him. Marian, the woman he
would have died to save&mdash;and then, strongly,
strangely, the coward's longing to escape from it all
possessed him like a devil; had he a pistol all would
soon be over. In one moment was concentrated
the agony of a lifetime. He thought he was going
mad. He put his hands to his reeling head, and
felt himself sinking by inches into black forgetfulness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"I say, old fellow, you had a close call!" was
what he next heard, in Marsden's voice. "Your
clothes were smoking; the picture's burned to a
crisp; and next time you fall asleep with a lighted
cigar in your mouth just have the fire-brigade
handy. This'll cost you in the neighborhood of
five hundred dollars' damage to furniture and books
alone."</p>

<p>"Thank God!" was all Macfarren answered.</p>

<h2 id="MISSY">LITTLE MISSY.</h2></div>


<p>Do you know the feeling of living in a house
pervaded by an unseen presence&mdash;a person who
has lived there once, and whose spirit seems to
dwell there forever afterward? That was what
Mrs. Jack Hereford felt when she and her husband
took refuge from New York and Newport and
Tuxedo at Malvern, the old Virginia plantation,
with its tumbledown house, full of rickety furniture,
and staring daubs of family portraits in every
room in it. The house and everything in it, and
six hundred acres of land grown up with pine saplings,
had been bought for a song from the heirs
of the estate, who had never seen it, and never
wanted to see it.</p>

<p>Colonel Baskerville had been the last owner of
the place, and he had been dead ten years; also
Mrs. Baskerville. And there had been three children&mdash;two
sons, one of whom was shot dead at
Gettysburg, and the other had died of wounds and
exposure. The daughter, Amy Baskerville, too, was
no more. All this Mrs. Hereford gathered from
the one or two persons she had met, and the old
doctor who was her nearest and only neighbor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
It was this Amy Baskerville whose shadowy,
girlish presence was all over Malvern. She was
only twenty when she died, as the plain headstone
in the old family burying-ground said. The brick
walls of the graveyard were crumbling, and the iron
gate had given way. Cattle and sheep browsed on
the green mounds. Many of the tombs of the
dead-and-gone Baskervilles were marble slabs supported
on pillars, of which the solid brick and
mortar had disappeared, leaving them like gigantic
tables. The later graves were sunken, especially
those of Colonel Baskerville and his wife, over
which a simple monument was raised, inscribed to
the memory of Colonel Marmaduke Baskerville
and Nancy, his wife. Those over the two sons
were highly ornate, and bore long epitaphs: "Marmaduke,
who was killed while gallantly leading his
regiment, after the fall of both his colonel and
lieutenant-colonel," followed by a long list of
Marmaduke's virtues; and "George, who died of
wounds contracted in the service of his country,
at the early age of eighteen." The story was
plain. The poor old colonel and his wife had put
up the showy tombstones with Pity weeping over
an urn, and their executors had put up the plain
stones over the father and mother and little Amy.</p>

<p>Hanging in the grim library, with its few old-fashioned
books upon the crazy shelves, were portraits
of the colonel, a veritable Virginia colonel,
with a tremendous shirt ruffle rushing out of his
generous bosom, and his rosy face wearing a look
of majestic solemnity common in portraits, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
which Colonel Baskerville never wore for five consecutive
minutes in his life. Then there were portraits
of George and Marmaduke, both handsome
lads, both as alike as two peas, and, besides, a portrait
of little Amy. She was about sixteen when
it was painted. It was so sweet, so sad! There
was not a trace of weakness in the half-womanish,
half-childish mouth and chin. In the delicate,
well-poised head one could see more will power,
more intellect, than in the portly colonel and both
of the handsome, frank-faced boys put together.
This was not Amy's only picture. There was an
old daguerreotype on the drawing-room table
which revealed her in a white dress, and half a
dozen faded photographs of her in her riding-habit,
in fancy dress, in numerous other costumes and
attitudes, sometimes with one, sometimes with
another, of her brothers; and a whole bookful of
sketches, scribbled all over, "The Book of Amy.
Life and Adventures of Amy Baskerville. By G.
B., Esq.," in which G. B., who had considerable
skill, pictured Amy in numberless grotesque and
humiliating circumstances, and once or twice as
she must truly have been, graceful and picturesque.</p>

<p>Then there were piles of old-fashioned, desperately
sentimental songs on the broken-down old
piano in the drawing-room, which had once been
sung by Amy's fresh young voice. One day Mrs.
Hereford came across a frayed little white satin
slipper that had been Amy's, and had evidently
done good service. It was the saddest little re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>minder
in the world. It was like the ghost of
youth and joy. And there was a broken fan, laid
away in tissue paper, and inscribed, "To be mended."
Mrs. Hereford locked these little girlish relics
up carefully in the drawer of the dressing-table in
what had been Amy's room. On the dressing-table
was an old-fashioned swinging glass, in which Amy
had once been wont to look roguishly, admiring
her own fresh beauty. The glass remained, but
Amy was dust and ashes.</p>

<p>One afternoon Mrs. Hereford, sitting on the
porch, around which the vines had grown in neglected
luxuriance, saw an old negro woman coming
up the pathway toward the house. She was
very infirm, and leaned upon the shoulder of a
little darky about ten years old, who dutifully supported
her. She stopped at the foot of the steps,
and, with an old-fashioned courtesy, said, "Good-evenin',
my mistis."</p>

<p>"Good-evening, aunty," replied Mrs. Hereford,
having learned that much of Southern etiquette.
"Won't you walk in and rest yourself?"</p>

<p>She crept painfully up the steps, and sat down
in the rush-bottomed chair offered her. The little
darky squatted on the steps, and fixed a pair of
bright black beads on "de lady f'um de Norf,"
which he never removed.</p>

<p>"You will 'scuse me, lady, fur troublin' you so
much as ter come here. But I hed to come&mdash;I
<i>hed</i> to come. It seem like I couldn't die 'twell
I hed done seed de ole place," she said, presently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are quite welcome," replied Mrs. Hereford.</p>

<p>"You see," she said, glancing deprecatingly at
Mrs. Hereford, while she smoothed down the clean
but faded handkerchief on her breast, "I was de
head 'oman in dis here house. I was ole mistis'
maid, an' den I nuss dem two boys, an' Miss Amy,
and arter dey was all gone I went, too. But I
done hed de ager so bad, an' I feel so po'ly I don't
never 'spect ter be able ter git here no mo'. So I
come, jest ter tell ole marse an' all un 'em how
things is lookin'. Kase I 'spects ter fin' 'em all
when I gits to glory, an' ole marse he sho to say,
'Keziah, how's things gwine at Malvern?' Lord!
when I got ter tell him de Yankees done bought
de place an' livin' here!"</p>

<p>"But, gra'mammy," said the little darky, who
had been to school and had imbibed some theology,
"dey doan' keer nuttin' 'bout Norverners
an' Souverners in heaben&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You shet yo' mouf, boy! You didn' never
know ole marse. Doan' make no diff'unce whar
he is, I lay he gwine cuss like a trooper when I
done tole him de Yankees is livin' at Malvern&mdash;an'
he sho' to arsk."</p>

<p>The youngster, more cowed by Aunt Keziah's
energy than her arguments, maintained a discreet
silence after this. Mrs. Hereford, who was a gentle
and merciful woman, said to her:</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like to go inside? It's very little
changed since we came."</p>

<p>"Thankee, lady," she said, rising and hobbling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
to the hall door. Her uncertain step was heard
going toward the library; then a long pause, and a
quicker return. "I c'yarn do it!&mdash;I c'yarn," she
panted, sitting down in her chair. "I thot I'd go
ev'ywhar, all 'bout de house, an' set down in ev'y
room; but seems ter me I hear dem voices callin'&mdash;ole
marse bawlin' out 'Keziah!' an' little missy
(she lisp when she talk) she say 'Kethiah'&mdash;an' I
couldn't stay no longer. I was sorry I come."</p>

<p>"Was it very long ago that it all happened?"</p>

<p>"'Twarn't so long dat I kin forgit it. Fust
time I ever feel like trouble was comin' was one
mornin' when little marse&mdash;dat was Marmaduke,
an' all de black folks call him young marse, 'cause
he was tall like he pa, an' was more'n twenty-one;
but I had done rock him when he was a baby, an' I
never could call him nuttin' but little marse&mdash;he rid
away fur to whip de Yankees. He help ter raise
a comp'ny, an' he was 'lected cap'n, an' dat mornin,'
right arter breakfast, he was gwine away. All de
black folks 'bout de house was out here on dis here
porch fur to tell him good-by, an' marse an' missis
an' little missy, an' Marse George an' me, an' all on
'em was smilin' an mighty gay 'cept me an' Marse
George. He was lookin' sorter black an' sulky
'cause he want ter go ter de war too; but he warn't
but sixteen years old, an' ole marse an' missis
wouldn't let him. When little marse come out, he
look so fine in his bran'-new uniform, an' Jake&mdash;dat
was he body servant&mdash;was settin' on one o' ole
marse's best horses, holdin' little marse's horse by
de bridle, an' jes' a grinnin', he was so happy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Young marse had he sword in he hand, an' little
missy&mdash;she warn't but fifteen&mdash;tooken it from him
an' snatch he cap off, an' strut up an' down ter
make ole marse laugh; an' den she buckle de
sword on agin, an' little marse he went up an'
shook hands wid ole marse, an' he say: 'Good-by,
father. You'll see me back 'fore de leaves fall.
'Twon't take long to whip dem chicken-hearted Yankees.'
An' missis she hol' him in her arms, an' she
kiss him, but she keep on smilin' an never shed a tear.</p>

<p>"I cry so hard I had ter run upsty'ars, an' I went
in little marse's room, an' set down in de cheer, an'
cried 'twell I couldn't cry no mo'. I got up den, an'
was gittin' out he nice white shirts an' he high
beaver hat fur to put 'em away 'ginst he come
home, when little missy she walk in. Her cheeks
was white like chalk, an' her big black eyes had a
kinder skeert look in 'em, an' she steal up ter me,
an' say, 'Oh, mammy, do you think he'll ever come
back?' an' fust thing <i>I</i> know she was cryin' wusser'n
me, an' I jes' took her in my lap like I useter
when she was a little gal, an' set down, an' say,
'H'ish! h'ish! in course he gwine ter come back.'
All dat day little missy she hang on ter me. Old
marse he stay down in de fiel' making 'tense he was
lookin' arter de han's, an' missis she shet herself up
in de store-room ter fix up de house-keepin' book,
an' I didn't see neither one 'twell dinner-time. Den
dey talk mighty cheerful, an' little missy she plague
George 'bout gwine ter de army, but I didn't hear
none on 'em say a word 'bout little marse. But <i>I</i>
know dey didn't furgit him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Arter dat things was mighty cur'us. Missis
she couldn't get no mo' clo'es, an' she put away all
her fine silks an' satins, an' all little missy's too,
an' her diamond comb, an' her lace shawl, an' wear
nuttin' but homespun. Little marse, he wroten
heaps 'o letters, an' he didn' furgit he po' ole black
mammy. He wroten me hisse'f, an' I got dem letters
in my chis' now. I c'yarn read 'em, but I loves
'em. An' all de time, I kep' a-honin' fur him, an'
skeert 'bout him. Mistis, she was a brave 'oman&mdash;she
never let on she was skeert. Night an' mornin',
when she read pr'yars in de dinin'-room, wid ole
marse an' little missy an' de house-servants settin'
roun', she pray fur little marse, 'twell sometimes ole
marse he wipe he eyes, an' I hed to fling my ap'on
over my hade an' cry; but her voice never shake
none. But <i>I</i> never did 'spect ter see him no mo',
an' one night&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here she hesitated. The dead and gone tragedy
rose up bodily before her eyes, and she paused a
moment, gasping in contemplation of it.</p>

<p>"One night I was settin' by de charmber fire, an'
I hear a cart come up ter de front do'; an' I wonder
what kin' o' folks 'twas comin' dat time o' night
in a cart. So I run out an' open de do' as soon as I
heerd de knock&mdash;an' 'twas our Jake. 'Whar's little
marse?' I ask him, ketchin' hol' on him. Jake look
at me, an' he was kinder ashy, an' he couldn't speak.
An' I hear ole marse an' missis comin'; an' sumpin'
was in de cart all covered up, an' two men was
takin' it out. When Jake seed missis, he start ter
trimble; an' ole marse he shout, 'Whar's yo' mars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>ter?&mdash;whar's
my son?' An' Jake he pint ter de
cart."</p>

<p>At this point she stopped. She took out a tattered
handkerchief and began to finger it nervously.
The afternoon shadows had lengthened since
she had begun.</p>

<p>"Dey brung de coffin in de parlor, an' sot it
down on cheers. He look jes' like he did de mornin'
he rid away, but bofe legs was broke. Nobody
teched him but me an' Jake. He hed two letters
in he pocket, an' one was a letter I had done got
little missy ter write fur me, tellin' him to take
keer o' hisself. Ole marse, he do mighty queer.
Arter ev'ything was fixed, he come an' set down
by de coffin, an' he never cry nor nuttin'&mdash;he jes'
put he han' ev'y now an' den on little marse's head,
an' say, 'My son, my son Marmaduke!' Missis
she set by him, an' talk ter him, an' pray wid him,
an' read de Bible to him, an' seem like she didn't
think 'bout nuttin' but comfortin' old marse. Little
missy she creep upsty'ars into little marse's room
an' flung herself on de floor, an' lay like she was
dead, 'twell I took her up in my arms, and settin'
down in de rockin'-cheer, she see me cryin', an' she
cry too.</p>

<p>"Ole marse he do jes' de same arter de funeral.
He set an' look at little marse's picter, an' he
wouldn't let nobody move he whip off'n de rack,
nor a ole p'yar o' spurs o' little marse's.</p>

<p>"Georgie hed been 'way at school. But one
day a letter come. Marse George hed done run
away ter jine de army. When dat letter come I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
seed missis put on a look I ain't furgot ter dis day.
Georgie was her favorite. An' 'fo' de winter was
out&mdash;'twas in de fall when Georgie run away&mdash;he
died in de horspital. He hed been writin' 'twarn't
nuttin' matter wid him, an' he'd be outen de horspital
'fo' missis could git ter him; but she was
gwine ter start de naix day. Ole marse fotch him
home. He warn't eighteen, an' he hed a little
muffstach comin', and he didn't look any older den
little missy when dey laid him by little marse. He
was de handsomest o' all de chillen.</p>

<p>"Dat kilt missis. Ole marse he done fur her
jes' like she hed done for him, an' little missy stay
by her night an' day; but one night, when de doctor
say she was gittin' better, she call me, an' she
say: 'Keziah, I'm dyin', an' I know it. Don't leave
yo' marster an' Amy. Stay by 'em faithful like you
has been ter me an' de boys.' An' de very naix
week she died. Missis was a Chrischun, if ever I
seed one. She would 'a lived if she could; but
what kilt Georgie kilt her too. Seemed ter me
arter dat like poor Keziah have ter see ole marse
an' little missy go too; but I kep' up as well as I
knowed how. Little missy was mighty pretty den.
She was mos' twenty, an' she kep' gittin' mo' an'
mo' like Georgie. De war was over den, an' some
de han's went off, an' dere warn't nobody but me
in de house, an' de cook an' Jake did de res' o' de
work. Ole marse he walk 'bout like he didn't keer
fur nuttin'. One day two men drive up in a shiny
new buggy, an' I hear 'em talkin' mighty sassy to
ole marse on de porch, an' pres'ny ole marse stan'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
up, an' he say out loud: 'Gent'men, take all.
Take my plantation, my house an' furniture, my
horses an' cattle an' stock an' ev'ything. I'm a
bankrup', but I'm a honest man.' An' dey try
ter smoove him down, an' arter a while dey went
off.</p>

<p>"'Bout dat time I heerd dey was some Yankee
orficers campin' out in de woods, an' one arternoon
one on 'em rid up ter de do' an' got down.
Ole marse an' little missy was settin' out;&mdash;'twas
summer-time. De minute I seed him I seed he was
like little marse, and little missy seed it too, 'cause
she tole me so. He was a gent'mun, ef ever I see
one&mdash;an' black folks kin tell gent'muns quicker'n
white folks kin&mdash;an' when he walk up de steps he
bow low to bofe on 'em, an' hol' he cap in he
han' all de time he was talkin'. He tole ole marse
he was a ingineer, an' hed come fur to make some
maps or sumpin', and he had done foun' a good
place fur a camp on de place, an' de Government
tell him he kin camp anywhar, but he wouldn't like
ter put up he tents an' things 'cept he had ole
marse's consent. Ole marse say, 'De Government
done took my two sons, all my servants, my horses,
cattle, sheep, an' ev'ything I hed, so I s'pose it can
take my plantation too.' De orficer turned red as
a beet, an' so did little missy, an' she got up an'
put her hand on ole marse's shoulder and said,
'Father!' jes' like missis. Den marser sorter
cooled down, an' said he didn't keer a cuss 'bout
de camp, an' de orficer thank him like he had give
him de plantation, and den he made a bow, an'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
one ter little missy, an' git on he horse an' ride
away.</p>

<p>"Arter dat he was here ev'y day. 'Twas allers
to see ole marse 'bout sumpin&mdash;'bout de crick, an'
de way de lan' slope, an' sich; but I watch him, an'
I see he warn't half listenin' ter ole marse, an' he
kep' he eyes on little missy. An' she useter look
at him sometimes, an' smile, an' turn away. An'
den he met me on de road one Sunday when I was
gwine ter meetin', an' he stop he horse an' say:
'Good-mornin', aunty. How's yo' mistis?' An'
when I tole him she was right peart, he laugh, an
drop a gol' dollar in my han'. I went home an' tole
little missy, and she turn red, an' say, 'It was very
saucy of him, mammy, an' I've got a great mind
ter make you send that money back.' But she
didn't.</p>

<p>"He kep' comin', an' missy kep' gittin' kinder
ter him, an' he was so perlite an' he voice were so
nice an' he were se'ch a gent'mun I couldn't help
thinkin' she gwi' fall in love wid him. An' one night
he come, an' arter he hed done tole ole marse good-night,
she come ter de door, an' he axed her to
come out on de porch, an' pres'ny, arter he hed been
talkin' ter her in a kinder whisper, he stan' up
straight an' open he arms, an' she slip in an' laid
her head on he shoulder.</p>

<p>"Jes' den ole marse come out. He look so white
it skeered me. Little missy raise her head, but de
orficer wouldn't let go her han'. Ole marse he
shake like he hed de ager, an' he say: 'Take yo'
choice. Go wid dat man, an' take yo' father's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
curse, an' never darken these doors, or sen' him
away where he b'longs, an' never speak ter him
again.' De orficer say: 'Colonel Baskerville, I
love your daughter, an' she loves me. You can't
separate us.' But ole marse he p'int he finger, an'
he holler, 'Take yo' choice.' An' little missy she
stan' fur a minnit or two like stone, an' den she
take her han' away an' say, 'Father can't do without
me. It would kill him. You must go.' De orficer
he look like he would hol' on ter her, but she turn an'
walk in de house, an' he got on he horse, lookin'
black an mizerbul, an' gallop off as hard as he could.</p>

<p>"I seed a look naix day in little missy's face like
missis when dey got dat letter 'bout Georgie. She
was gwine ter die&mdash;I knowed it. Warn't nuttin'
matter wid her&mdash;she went like missis. Ole marse
he done ev'ything fur her; she never say a cross
word ter him, but I b'lieve he wish she hed. Ev'y
night I ondress her an' put her ter bed like when
she was a little gal, an' ev'y night she got lighter
an' lighter. 'Oh, mammy,' she would say, 'I'm so
tired!' an' she didn't do nuttin' either. Ole marse
he walk de floor all night. I heerd him, an' so did
little missy. 'Poor father!' she would say. Den
one day, arter de doctor hed been here an' gone,
ole marse he go in de library an' he write a letter,
an' he tear it up; an' he write 'nother one, an' he
tear dat one up; an' at las' he write one an' he
tooken it upst'yars an' he lay it on little missy's bed
an' went out. 'Twas ter de orficer. Little missy
she read it, an' she say, 'It's too late.' An' sho
'nough, 'twas."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>She stopped again and paused. The shadows
were very long by this. It was nearly night.</p>

<p>"He got here befo' dey put her in de groun'.
He stan' by de grave, an' when de yearth fell in on
de coffin he say to hisself, 'Amy! Amy!'</p>

<p>"I stayed by ole marse. I knowed 'twarn't fur
long. It come one day when he was settin' in he
cheer on de porch. He didn't move fur so long I
was skeered. I went up to him, an' he was dead.
Arter dat I went away. De orficer he give me some
money, an' he tole me he'd sen' me some mo' ev'y
year&mdash;an' dat's what I lives on. I c'yarn come here
no mo'. I c'yarn go to de graveyard. Evy'whar I
sees my chillen like when dey was little. I hear
little missy sayin', 'Kethiah! Kethiah!' I 'spects
ter see 'em soon, an' I wants ter tell 'em 'bout de
ole place. I thankee kindly fur takin' keer o'
things."</p>

<p>She limped down the steps and soon was far
down the narrow path, and her bent and crippled
form melted away into the twilight.</p>

<h2 id="CAREW">THE SEA FORTUNES OF DICKY
CAREW.</h2></div>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>The sun shone so bright at Portsmouth Harbor
that afternoon that everything was gold and
green and white except the black hulls of the ships
and the great gray forts, out of which the
guns sometimes bellowed warnings to Boney
across the water. And right out in the golden
light lay his Majesty's ship-of-the-line Xantippe,
riding statelily at anchor, like a queen of the
seas upon her throne, so noble and commanding
was she. But all the beauty and glory of sunlit
harbor and white-walled town and sky and ships
was as black as midnight to Dicky Carew when
the dreadful summons came:</p>

<p>"Please, sir, the captain wants to see you in his
cabin."</p>

<p>When Dicky stood inside the cabin facing the
captain, stern, handsome, and as neat as wax, a
sorrier-looking object than Dicky Carew would
have been hard to find. His cap, which he held
in his hand and twirled dolefully, had a big hole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
torn in the top, his jacket was white with dust, and
right across his nose was a large black smut.
Captain Sarsfield examined him carefully from the
top of his tousled yellow head down to his unblacked
shoes, Dicky blushing furiously all the
while.</p>

<p>"A pretty spectacle you are, Mr. Carew, for an
officer and a gentleman!" For although Dicky
was only fifteen and barely five feet high, he was a
middy and a gentleman.</p>

<p>Dicky said nothing, but continued to twirl his
cap, while his eyes roamed uneasily around the
captain's orderly cabin. And there, sitting on a
sofa, with a dolly in her lap, was a little dark-eyed
girl dressed in mourning, who was watching Dicky
with great interest.</p>

<p>"What have you been doing, sir, to get yourself
in such a mess as you are?"</p>

<p>"Catching cockroaches down in the hold, sir,
with Barham," answered Dicky, in a quavering
voice.</p>

<p>"A nice employment for two young gentlemen.
When I was a midshipman, I employed my leisure
in studying my profession."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. That's what all the officers tell us.
Barham and I are the only fellows I ever heard
of that did anything but study their profession."</p>

<p>Captain Sarsfield looked very hard indeed at
Dicky. Was it possible that this dirty and ingenuous
youth was poking fun at a post-captain? But
could deceit reside in those innocent eyes and that
timid, boyish voice? The captain was in doubt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"At all events," he continued, with an appalling
look at the smut on Dicky's sunburned nose,
"your appearance, sir, is disgraceful. I believe
you are the dirtiest midshipman in his Majesty's
service, and you will be docked of leave to go
ashore for the next eight days."</p>

<p>The captain was about to deliver Dicky a lecture,
when an orderly tapped at the cabin door and
saluted.</p>

<p>"The new cutter has come, sir, and is about to
be taken aboard."</p>

<p>The captain got up and went out without remembering
to send Dicky back into the steerage,
where he belonged.</p>

<p>As Dicky continued to stand, cap in hand, he
would certainly have boohooed right out if he had
not been an officer and a gentleman. Dicky,
when he remembered that, gulped down two large
sobs that rose in his throat, and winked his eyes to
keep the tears back. Was there ever another such
unlucky fellow as he, Dicky Carew, he asked himself,
dismally. There was Barham, that was just
as busy with the cockroaches as he was, and yet
Barham's jacket wasn't dirty nor his nose smutted,
and if the captain had sent for him he would
have turned up as trig as the captain himself.
And how many times a week Dicky was mast-headed
for untidiness, and how often had he
ridden to London and back on the spanker
boom for that same fault, only Dicky himself
could tell.</p>

<p>While he was pursuing these melancholy reflec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>tions
the little girl on the sofa had fixed her dark
eyes on him.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I'm dirty," answered Dicky, desperately. "I
tub and scrub as much as any of 'em, but the captain
can't see what I am underneath, and he thinks
because I'm dirty outside I'm dirty all over."</p>

<p>"The captain is my papa," said Miss Bright
Eyes.</p>

<p>"I wish he was <i>my</i> papa," remarked Dicky,
sadly, "if he'd be any easier on me."</p>

<p>Girls, as a rule, possessed no charm for Dicky;
but this was such a very little one&mdash;not more than
ten years old&mdash;that he regarded her as an infant,
and rather a pretty one.</p>

<p>"I'm staying in Portsmouth," she continued,
nursing her dolly very carefully, "with my governess
and my nurse. My mamma is dead. She
died only a month ago&mdash;before papa's ship got
here&mdash;and I come on board nearly every day to
see my papa. Sometimes, if it rains, I stay all
night. I have a funny little bed made up in papa's
sleeping cabin, and in the morning I get up and
make his tea for him."</p>

<p>That story about her mamma went to Dicky's
heart.</p>

<p>"And my mother got to Portsmouth this morning
to see me, and she hasn't much money, and
can only stay a week, and I can't go ashore to see
her because I didn't keep my face clean and
mussed my jacket."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you behave yourself, then?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
promptly and severely asked his young friend.
"Papa always behaved himself when he was a little
boy like you."</p>

<p>This last very much incensed Dicky.</p>

<p>"Now look here, young lady," he said, "I'm an
officer and a gentleman! Didn't you hear your
father call me so just now? And if people in this
ship call the officers 'little boys,' they'll get put in
irons as likely as not. As for the officers behaving
themselves when they were midshipmen, everybody
knows they were angels&mdash;sea-angels&mdash;and the steerage
was a little heaven. Oh, they didn't catch
cockroaches&mdash;not they! And all the time they
weren't on duty they were studying or saying their
prayers. And as for skylarking, why, they never
heard of such a thing! I'll tell you what&mdash;eh,
what's your name?"</p>

<p>"Polly," answered Bright Eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, Polly, it ain't true that 'whom the gods
love die young'; for if it were, there wouldn't be
an officer of this ship alive to-day. Barham and I
ain't going to die young, though. The gods don't
love us, nor the captain neither."</p>

<p>"You oughtn't to talk so about dying," answered
Polly, gravely. "You never had your mamma
to die. Sometimes, when I've stayed on board
all night, I've waked up and seen papa sitting by
me, looking so strange and sad, and I know he is
thinking about mamma, although he says, 'Go to
sleep, my dear, nothing is the matter!' and I can
see the tears on his cheek; and my papa is a brave
sailor too. He says he knows I ought to go to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
school, but he can't bear to part with me." This
very proudly.</p>

<p>"I dare say," said Dicky, mournfully, "it will
break my mother's heart when she has come all
this long way to see me, and can't see me. And
she will be sure to think I have done something
scandalous. I know she will!"</p>

<p>This worked so upon Polly's feelings that she
said:</p>

<p>"Come here, and I'll get some pictures and
show you."</p>

<p>"I can't," answered Dicky. "I've got to stand
here until the captain comes back."</p>

<p>"Then I'll come to you," said Polly.</p>

<p>When the captain got back he found Polly sitting
on the floor, with her lap full of pictures, and
Dicky on the floor too, explaining them to her.
The captain was quite in the cabin before Dicky
heard a step. Then he jumped up, stood perfectly
rigid, and blushed scarlet. It was bad enough to
be caught at boyish tricks on the quarter-deck,
which had sometimes happened, but to be found
playing on the floor with a little girl was a reflection
on his manhood. However, the captain did
not seem very angry. He only said, "You may go,
sir, and don't let me have to speak to you again
about your personal appearance!" and Dicky fancied
he saw something like a smile on Captain
Sarsfield's face. Dicky said, "Yes, sir," and bowed
to the captain, and then to the little girl.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Miss Polly," said he. It had been
"Polly" and "Dicky" before the captain came in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
"Ain't you going to give me a kiss?" asked
Polly in a surprised voice.</p>

<p>Dicky could get no redder than he was, but his
hair almost stood on end, while he darted out and
down the ladder, never stopping until he got to his
own nook in the steerage.</p>

<p>"Girls are deuced bothersome&mdash;damme if they
ain't," he remarked to Barham&mdash;these young gentlemen,
in privacy, swearing quite mannishly, and
discussing the feminine sex with a great assumption
of knowingness.</p>

<p>Up in the cabin, the captain had said, "Polly!"
in a reproving voice, and Polly had climbed up on
his knee and kissed him, by way of answer.</p>

<p>"Do you know, papa, Dicky's mother is poor.
She is the widow of an officer who was killed by
that wicked Boney at the battle of the Nile"&mdash;for
in those days Boney was supposed to command on
sea as well as on land&mdash;"and Dicky was only ten
years old, and his mother has come to Portsmouth
to see him, and she can only stay a week, so Dicky
won't be able to see her."</p>

<p>"Ah," said the captain, stroking his little daughter's
hair.</p>

<p>"And she is staying in a little gray house, the
next but one to the gate leading into the great
dock yard. Papa, I would like to go to see Dicky's
mother the next time we go ashore, and tell her that
Dicky hasn't done anything very bad&mdash;because he
says she'll think he has been very, very naughty&mdash;and
tell her it's only because he is so dirty."</p>

<p>"You may go this afternoon," said the captain;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
"and perhaps I may let Dicky off before the week
is out."</p>

<p>The next day, as Dicky was rather disconsolately
poring over a book on seamanship, another
summons came to the cabin. Dicky was in perfect
order, for a wonder, and looked considerably less
frowsy and blowzy than he had the day before.
When he entered the captain's room the captain
was at the table, writing, and Polly, on her knees
on the cushioned seat, was peering out of the port-hole;
but she turned around when Dick entered.</p>

<p>"Mr. Carew," said the captain, sternly, "I hope
I impressed upon you yesterday the necessity for
absolute personal neatness in your attire. The
punishment I gave you, however, I have concluded
to partially remit. After to-day, you may go
ashore when you can get leave."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," replied Dicky, blushing with
pleasure; "and&mdash;and&mdash;Captain Sarsfield, I'm not&mdash;as
dirty as I look."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it, sir," responded Captain
Sarsfield, gravely. "Good afternoon."</p>

<p>Still Dicky lingered. He wanted to say a word
to Polly, but he couldn't do it with the captain's
grave eyes fixed on him. So he only hung about
for a moment, then said, "Good-by, Miss Polly,"
and vanished.</p>

<p>Dicky's mother was delighted to see him next
day, and Dicky gave her such a bear hug, as he
sometimes did Barham, that his mother shrieked,
while she laughed and covered his face with kisses.</p>

<p>"And Dicky, such a dear little girl, all dressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
in black, came here yesterday with her nurse! She
was little Polly Sarsfield, the captain's daughter,
and she told me why you couldn't come ashore,
and that the captain, hearing I was here, had concluded
to remit your punishment. I knew my dear
boy wasn't punished for insubordination, or swearing,
or gambling. If I thought that possible, it
would break your mother's heart."</p>

<p>Dicky felt rather uncomfortable at his mother's
supreme confidence in him, and was glad she didn't
know everything that went on among the young
gentlemen in the steerage.</p>

<p>"And Polly is a jolly little thing," remarked
Dicky. "Nothing but a baby, though."</p>

<p>"Polly will be a young lady by the time you
are a man," answered his mother, who did not
take Dicky's assumption of manliness seriously.</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw!" remarked Dicky, with a blush.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>In those days, when England was at war with
France and half of Europe, promotion was sometimes
rapid; and when Dicky had not got very far
in his twenties he had been gazetted three times,
and actually commanded a little eighteen-gun brig
that carried as much manliness and courage as
anything afloat. Dicky walked the deck of his little
vessel, the Hornet, as proudly as Captain Sarsfield
walked his splendid quarter-deck on his new
line-of-battle ship&mdash;the Indomptable, finer even
than the old Xantippe. And Dicky had developed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
into a model of sailor-and-officer-like neatness,
and kept his ship as clean as a lady's boudoir.
And one bright day the Hornet came sailing into
Portsmouth Harbor, her sails and rigging roughly
patched where the shot had torn through, with
holes covered with bright new planking in her
black sides, with four of her guns shattered at
their muzzles, but bravely towing a French sloop
of war almost twice as big as the little Hornet.
The Frenchman, too, could barely keep afloat, but
he had ten good guns that Dicky had brought
home in place of the four he had lost. And Dicky,
seeing the great, big, splendid Indomptable anchored
in the harbor, stood boldly in and dropped
his anchor just astern of her. Dicky knew well
enough who commanded the Indomptable.</p>

<p>Oh, what shouting and hurrahing there was
when the people in the ships and those on shore
made out the little Hornet! And what dipping of
flags and waving of caps and cheering when the
little vessel had come to anchor! And then, when
Dicky, in a very small and shabby gig, with only
four men at the oars, and some of them with their
heads or their legs bound up, was rowed to the
admiral's ship, there was more cheering and shouting,
which made Dicky's heart swell.</p>

<p>That very afternoon, by the time Dicky had
got back on board the Hornet, a gig very unlike
the Hornet's gig put off from the big Indomptable,
and presently Captain Sarsfield clambered up the
side, and Dicky, looking very red and pleased,
holding his cap in his hand very much as he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
done when Captain Sarsfield sent for him to scold
him about his untidiness and general naughtiness,
received the captain at the gangway.</p>

<p>"Let me congratulate you," said Captain Sarsfield,
shaking his hand warmly. "What a trouncing
you gave the Frenchman to be sure! How
you managed to keep afloat I can't see."</p>

<p>"We are badly knocked to pieces," answered
Dicky, "and on that account I hope you will excuse
the appearance of things. The ship isn't as
clean as I'd like her to be."</p>

<p>The Hornet was, though, as clean as hands
could make her, her brass-work shining and her
deck snow-white, although some of her spars were
in splinters and things generally broken up. As
for Dicky, he looked as if he had been parboiled
and sand-papered and then hung out to dry, so
clean was he; and he had the air of having just
stepped out of a bandbox. Captain Sarsfield
grinned at Dicky.</p>

<p>"You are certainly cleaner than you used to
be," said he.</p>

<p>The captain had to hear all about the fight off
Cherbourg, where Dicky sailed in under the very
guns of the forts and made the Frenchman come
out to fight. It seemed very unequal at first, as
the Frenchman had the most men and the most
metal. But Dicky plainly had the most seamanship,
and, in a running fight that lasted four hours,
he cut the French ship up so that at last, when she
struck, nothing but a tow line and her nearness to
Portsmouth saved her from going to the bottom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Both the Frenchman and Dicky were too far gone
to carry the prisoners back to Portsmouth. These
had been transferred to another vessel, but Dicky
had the Frenchman's captain and her ensign and
ten guns, which was good for Dicky.</p>

<p>Dicky was dying to ask Captain Sarsfield about
Polly; but, although he had been gazetted three
times, he was so afraid of the captain that he could
not get it out to save his life until just as Captain
Sarsfield was leaving.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;how&mdash;how is Miss Polly?" asked Dicky,
looking sheepish and blushing furiously.</p>

<p>"Very well," answered the captain, "and at
present paying me a little visit. When you
come to dinner to-morrow you will see her. She
is quite a young lady&mdash;sixteen her last birthday."</p>

<p>Young ladies grew up earlier then, and sixteen
was considered quite old. So Dicky went, and
found Polly a grown-up young lady, with full muslin
skirts down to her heels, a short-waisted bodice
belted just under her arms, and a large poke-bonnet.
Dicky was very shy, but Polly was not,
and rallied him unmercifully, even cruelly alluding
to the smut on his nose, which she had remembered
all those years.</p>

<p>Things were very pleasant about that time to
Dicky; but then the war closed soon after, much
to Dicky's disgust, who had wild dreams of commanding
a fifty-gun sloop of war at least before
Boney was finally done for; and Dicky saw, disconsolately
enough, that he was well off to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
got the little Hornet, and that he would not get
anything better for a long while.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Dicky had been making hay while
the sun shone, and a day had come when he went
on board the Indomptable to ask Captain Sarsfield
a very important question indeed&mdash;which
was whether Polly and himself could get married.
Dicky was terribly frightened, but managed to appear
tolerably self-possessed as he sat in Captain
Sarsfield's cabin, although he could not help twiddling
his cap desperately under the table. The
captain was as grave and stern as ever, and gave
Dicky no manner of help while he was blundering
and floundering about, trying to tell the captain
how much he loved Polly, although it was perfectly
plain that Captain Sarsfield, or anybody with half
an eye, for that matter, must have known directly
what ailed Dicky.</p>

<p>Then Dicky told the captain that he had a snug
sum of prize money put by, which should be Polly's,
and the captain had said that Polly was not
quite dowerless, and the whole thing was arranged,
Captain Sarsfield shaking Dicky's hand formally,
and wishing the young couple might be as happy
as he and Polly's mother had been, long years ago.
And for a wonder, Captain Sarsfield appeared to
think that perhaps Polly and Dicky might have
something to say to each other, and considerately
stalked up and down the quarter-deck for a full
hour, while the young ones had a rapturous interview
in the cabin. When Dicky got back to the Hornet,
he sent for Barham, who was his first-lieuten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>ant,
and they hugged each other and danced round
in the cabin very much as they had done when
they found amusement in catching cockroaches in
the old Xantippe.</p>

<p>Polly and Dicky were to be married in the
spring. Dicky was cruising about the English Channel,
getting into Portsmouth for a few days every
month, where the Indomptable was lying awaiting
her turn to be overhauled and repaired, for she
too had got a shot or two from Boney before he
got away to Elba.</p>

<p>One bright day in spring, as bright as the one
on which Dicky first met Polly, the Hornet was
coming into Portsmouth. There was a spanking
breeze from the sea that tossed the white caps
high, and the little Hornet was skimming along
under all the sail she could carry. Now, although
French ships had begun to appear again in English
ports by that time, they were rather unusual; so
Dicky, who was on the bridge of the Hornet, was
rather surprised to see a big French frigate, the Alceste,
sailing slowly out of the inner harbor. She
was a fine ship, but she was sailing like a hay-stack,
one mile ahead and three miles to leeward. The
passage into the harbor of Portsmouth is narrow&mdash;not
more than four or five hundred yards across&mdash;and
from the lubberly way the Alceste was tacking
about, she would probably take all the room there
was, and considerably more if she could get it, to
come out, and leave none at all for the little
Hornet; but Dicky wasn't afraid of that. When it
came to navigating a ship in a tight place, young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Captain Carew was a match for any man who sailed
the seas. In those days England claimed the sovereignty
of the narrow seas, and exacted that a man-of-war,
of any other nation whatsoever, on meeting a
British war-ship in those waters, should salute the
British ensign by lowering her topsails. Naturally,
this was peculiarly hateful to French captains, who
not infrequently omitted it, when the French ship
was very big and the British ship very little. Then
a long official correspondence would follow, but no
French captain was ever punished for this defiance
of the might of England. Dicky Carew, however,
was not the man to consider the difference between
a big ship and a little one where the respect due
the flag he carried was at stake. His ensign was
set, which was a hint to the French ship that her
topsails must come down.</p>

<p>But the Alceste seemed in no hurry to show her
manners. The fresh breeze that filled her ill-set
sails kept most of her people busy, the sailors
bustling about the decks with more chattering and
noise than Captain Carew would have allowed on
his ship in a month. But not a man went near her
topsail halliards.</p>

<p>From the way the Alceste was lurching about,
it began to look very doubtful if the little Hornet
could pass in the narrow passage to the harbor,
where it was plain they would meet; but Dicky
Carew had no notion of shortening sail and hanging
around outside until the Frenchman had got
out. So in contrast to the great lumbering Alceste,
the little Hornet came dashing on, with a free wind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
making about two knots to the Alceste's one, and
her course as straight as the crow flies. The French
captain, who was also on his bridge, saw that the
Hornet had no mind to stand out of his way, but
he laughed as he looked at his own big hull and
towering masts, and saw the little Hornet, whose
mainmast was no higher than the Alceste's lower
spars. And not the slightest sign was made that
his topsails were to be lowered.</p>

<p>Now Dicky could stand the Alceste's bad seamanship,
but it didn't suit him to take the Alceste's
snub, and then sit down and write to the Admiralty
and complain about it. He had been used to teaching
Frenchmen to behave themselves, and he meant
to do so now.</p>

<p>"Barham," said he to his first lieutenant, "the
rascals don't mean to salute."</p>

<p>"Report 'em to the Admiralty as soon as we
come to anchor," responded Barham.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't it be better to smash his cabin
windows, and splinter one of his starboard boats
beforehand&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Decidedly better," said Barham, whose blood
was up too. "With such a lot of landsmen and
marines as they've got aloft, it will go hard if the
Hornet can't scrape some of the paint off his sides."</p>

<p>By this time the French captain saw what was
coming. The Hornet was standing up beautifully
to the breeze, and apparently making straight for
the Alceste. In two minutes more she was right
on his starboard quarter, and the French sailors
began to yell. Barham had taken the wheel, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
kept his eye on Captain Carew, when, as Dicky
waved his hand, Barham threw down the helm, and
the little Hornet scraped so close to the Alceste that
the quartermaster, taking up a boat-hook, jammed
it through the Alceste's cabin windows, bawling:</p>

<p>"Take that for yer manners, ye ornsightly lubbers!"</p>

<p>And then there was a crash&mdash;a boat on the Alceste's
starboard quarter was gone, and as the big
frigate lurched across the yard of blue water between
them, the little Hornet's stanch mizzen mast
struck the Alceste's lower spars, that were only half
secured, and tore through the rigging as if it were
a cobweb. In another minute the Hornet with her
helm righted had danced off, her men cheering and
jeering, while the French captain fairly danced
with rage, and shook his fist at Captain Carew,
who raised his cap, and bowed and smiled politely.</p>

<p>Of course it was very wrong, and Captain Carew
knew it, particularly when he saw the Alceste
deliberately put about to return to Portsmouth.
Dicky began to have dreadful visions of being
obliged to go on the Alceste in full uniform, and
make an apology to the French captain, than which
he would much rather have had an arm cut off.</p>

<p>But all this was forgotten when Dicky caught
sight of the Indomptable, for Polly was still in
Portsmouth, and not many days passed without
the captain's daughter coming on board the big
frigate with her father for an hour or two. Polly
loved the Indomptable, as she had done the old
Xantippe, and was quite as much at home on her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
although she no longer had a little bed in her
father's cabin. Captain Sarsfield looked very
serious when Dicky told him about it, and things
generally began to look grave when the French
ambassador came down to Portsmouth and looked
at the Alceste, and then took the French captain
back to London with him. Dicky was not a whit
behindhand in making his report to the Admiralty
about the French ship's omission&mdash;but that was all
he was entitled to do. The jabbing the boat-hook
through the Alceste's cabin windows, and the
smashing her boat, while the Hornet's first lieutenant
was at the wheel and her captain on the bridge,
was altogether another thing. And in a very little
time indeed came the order for a court-martial, and
young Captain Carew was ordered to turn his ship
over to his first lieutenant, and consider himself
under arrest. What a stir it made! And the people
all said, "If they break him for crippling a ship
twice his size, without getting a scratch, they will
have hard work finding another captain who can
do it; and if every man resented an affront to the
British ensign like that, why, it never would be
safe to affront it."</p>

<p>The captains, sitting stern and solemn around
the table in the admiral's cabin, heard the whole
story. In vain they tried to bring out that accident
had something to do with it; but Dicky, cool
and calm, declared openly that he had done it on
purpose, and would do it again, to any man that
did not salute the ensign flying on his Majesty's
ship Hornet&mdash;if he could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
The courts-martial in those times did not keep
a man long in suspense. There was indeed a fearful
dispatch in taking an officer's commission away
from him. One whole May day was Dicky on the
rack, and he knew his fate before he left the admiral's
ship. He left it a free man&mdash;free with the
dreadful freedom of a man whose country disowns
him. Track would be kept of him, so the
Admiralty could set its seal of condemnation on
him too, but otherwise he could go where he
pleased.</p>

<p>The first use he made of this new and terrible
liberty, was to go on board the Indomptable, where
he was shown into the captain's cabin. Dicky
was as white as a sheet, but he held his head up
manfully.</p>

<p>"Captain Sarsfield" he said "I am a ruined
man. I have been dismissed the service of my
country. I came to say that although I am not
conscious of having done anything to disgrace my
name, I can no longer ask your daughter to accept
it."</p>

<p>Captain Sarsfield too was pale. He loved Dicky,
but he could not bring himself to give Polly to a
cashiered officer, and he said so. But just then
Polly herself appeared, and marching up to Dicky,
with blazing eyes, she put her hand on his arm.</p>

<p>"But I want to marry him, <i>and I will</i>!" she
said. "He is the best sailor in the British navy,
and if they cashier him because he can do what
hardly anybody else can do, very well. Papa, I
shall marry him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Captain Sarsfield rubbed his eyes to see if he
were awake or dreaming. Was this his quiet, gentle
Polly? As for Dicky, his heart swelled, but he
removed her hand gently from his arm.</p>

<p>"No, Polly," he said; "your father is right. I
could not bring you down to be the wife of a
man counted unfit to serve his king and his country."</p>

<p>"But I am not afraid of being poor," said Polly,
with tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>"It is not that, my dear," answered Dicky, in
a husky voice. "It is because I am broken&mdash;don't
you see? I shall have to take off the uniform
that I had hoped to wear as long as I lived. I
shall have to either live in my own country as a
discredited man, or carry my discredit with me to
another country; no, Polly."</p>

<p>"But I say I will!" answered Polly, fiercely.</p>

<p>"Good-by," said Dicky, taking her hand. "You
are too generous; it would be cruel to take advantage
of you, dear Polly&mdash;"</p>

<p>The captain had been standing there all the
time. Both Dicky and Polly had forgotten him
until he spoke.</p>

<p>"Now, Polly," said he, firmly, "this must stop.
Carew is right."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Polly, standing up very
straight and bold, "he may refuse to marry me
now; but I mean to let him know once a year that
I am ready and waiting for him, until&mdash;until he
finds somebody else."</p>

<p>"There's no danger of that," said Dicky, kiss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>ing
her hand; "but you and I can never be married
now, Polly."</p>

<p>Dicky did not go back to the Hornet, but went
ashore and to an inn, where, calling for a private
room, he sat and tried to look the thing in the face
like a man; but he couldn't. His profession gone,
his mother's heart broken, separated from Polly,
no longer Captain Carew, commanding his Majesty's
ship Hornet, but plain Dicky Carew commanding
nothing at all.</p>

<p>Oh, poor Dicky! How much easier would it
have been to be killed in those sea-fights with
Boney's ships! What was he to do? All night
long Dicky sat up and walked the floor, and when
day broke he was so haggard and miserable that
he was ashamed to show himself. All day he sat
in his little room; he would wait until nightfall
before he took the coach for London. Disgraced
men ought to hide themselves from the light of
day. Toward evening, just as he was preparing to
go out, a furious knocking came at his door.
Dicky opened it, and there stood a functionary
all in scarlet and gold&mdash;a king's messenger, so
Dicky knew. The messenger, making a low
bow, handed a packet to Dicky. "I was directed
to deliver this into Mr. Carew's own hands," he
said.</p>

<p>Dicky winced. It was the first time that he
had been called "Mr. Carew."</p>

<p>Dicky broke the big red seal, and found two
documents inclosed. One was a letter from the
Admiralty, and this is what it said:</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>


<p class="p2 i2"><span class="smcap">Richard Carew, Esq.</span>: Sir.&mdash;I am directed
by the Lords of the Admiralty to inform you that
the sentence of the late court-martial, finding you
guilty of willfully running into the French frigate
Alceste, coming out of Portsmouth Harbor, on the
25th of March, has been submitted to his Majesty
in council, and the decision of the court&mdash;viz., that
you be deprived of your commission as commander&mdash;has
been approved by his Majesty, without regarding
the provocation you were under, or the
great skill, daring, and capable seamanship you
displayed on the occasion. But his Majesty herewith
incloses you a commission under the royal
seal as post-captain, and directs you to take command
of his majesty's ship Hornet, now lying in
Portsmouth Harbor; and may all impudent Frenchmen
be served like the Alceste, as long as British
hearts of oak endure!"</p>

<p class="p2">And then followed signatures and seals. But
Dicky could read no more; and although he was
as brave a fellow as ever stepped, he fell down on
his knees and cried like a woman or a baby.</p>

<p>Within a month Dicky and Polly were married.
The day was beautiful and bright, and the little
Hornet was dressed with bunting from rail to
main-truck, and the wedding bells clashed so merrily
that they were heard half across the water to
Cherbourg.</p>



<p class="i7 p2"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;In Thackeray's Roundabout Papers he says: "In
George II's time there was a turbulent young lieutenant, Tom
Smith by name, who was broke on complaint of the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
ambassador for obliging a French ship of war to lower her topsails
to his ship at Spithead. But by the king's orders, Tom
was next day made a captain." Tom's picture is at Greenwich.
He was called "Handsome Smith," but his portrait is by no
means so handsome as his conduct.</p>

<h2 id="KOURASOFFS">THE KOURÁSOFFS.</h2></div>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>My acquaintance with the brothers Kourásoff
commenced as far back as when I was sub-professor
at the Polytechnic Institute in St. Petersburg and
Loris, the elder, was in the Guards, while Vladimir,
the younger, was still at the School of Gunnery.
These two brothers were commonly mistaken
for twins, although Loris was no less than four
years older than Vladimir; but, though Nature had
made them outwardly alike, she had not failed to
mark an extraordinary difference in their characters.
Fortune, too, having endowed them equally
in the first instance, had unequivocally declared one
to be her favored child.</p>

<p>Vladimir Kourásoff was by turns morose and
flippant. He had managed to encumber himself
with debts even sooner than young Russian nobles
usually do, and was, moreover, suspected of inclining
to revolutionary principles. The Government
took good care to be informed of everything
Vladimir Kourásoff said and did.</p>

<p>Loris, on the contrary, enjoyed a high degree of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
imperial favor. He had been sent, at his own request,
to take command in one of the disturbed
districts near the Turkestan frontier&mdash;a position
which he filled to the satisfaction of the Government
and of the local authorities too, a thing difficult
to do. About this time he invented a new fuse,
which was approved by the Ministry of War, and
for which he declined to accept any compensation,
which induced the emperor to decorate him. He
belonged to the true party of order and progress,
which seeks to improve the Russ as he is without
vainly attempting to turn him into a German or a
Frenchman. His estates near Wilna were said to
prove by their flourishing condition that emancipation
could be turned to the mutual benefit of proprietor
and serf. Of his private character my great
affection for him makes me speak with diffidence.
I can only say that he had a multitude of friends
who shared my opinion of him. His talents and
accomplishments were adorned with a singular modesty,
which, if it did not disarm jealousy, at least
silenced it.</p>

<p>The Russ is essentially democratic; therefore it
is not remarkable that Count Loris Kourásoff, one
of the darlings of St. Petersburg society, should
have for his friend a sub-professor who lived in
modest lodgings in an unfashionable quarter beyond
the Izaak bridge. Once a year we usually
took a journey together; and one summer he accompanied
me to Germany on a mission of a sentimental
nature, which, if not settled to my satisfaction,
was at least settled, and I set myself to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
forgetting Maria von Spreckeldsen as quickly as I
could. This proved to be easier than I had imagined;
and, though I wept tears of rage, and
Maria tears of disappointment, when her father
refused to let us marry on my salary as sub-professor,
the anguish of both subsided by degrees,
leaving only a feeling of placid regret. Maria,
who could not talk philosophy so well as I, acted it
much better, and in less than a year married Herr
Sachs, one of the richest brewers in Bavaria; and
when I last saw her I thought I would not exchange
the image which dwelt in my heart of my
adored Maria in her youthful slenderness for the
excellent but stout Madame Sachs, while I am sure
she would not have given her brewer for all the
professors in Russia and Germany together. But
we still correspond (with the full approbation of
Herr Sachs), and in our letters call each other
Gottlieb and Maria. O youth! O folly! O Maria!</p>

<p>Count Loris frequently complained that my affair
with Maria had destroyed his fondest illusions,
and that my inconstancy, as he was pleased to call
my devotion to my ideal Maria, had made him a
skeptic in love. He seemed to take a cruel pleasure
in listening to my most harrowing reminiscences,
and when we dined together always toasted Maria
with a variety of unfeeling remarks.</p>

<p>I had never visited the Wilna estates of Count
Kourásoff, but in the summer of 18&mdash;, being engaged
in making studies of Russian village life, I
presented myself at Ivánofka. Count Loris was
at home when I arrived, and was overjoyed to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
me. The house was very much like French chateaux
of the best class, and maintained in a state
of order and repair not always found in Russia.
Everything showed a generous but wise expenditure.
The village gave evidences of thrift and
industry. The communal land, as well as that belonging
to Count Kourásoff, was under an excellent
system of husbandry. Instead of the complicated
agricultural machinery for which the Russian proprietors
have a mania, while their plows are made
after the model of those used in the time of Iwan
the Terrible, I found at Ivánofka that they had
judiciously improved on their common tools and
implements. The barley was of a superior order,
and the cattle were fat and well-shaped. All the
credit for this state of things was awarded to
Count Kourásoff. It was he who had given Iwan
Tiska a horse when his own died of lockjaw; it
was he who had paid Mother Karlitch for her flax
when it was all burned up; it was he who had
given them seed in the year of the bad harvest.
In short, the inhabitants of Ivánofka regarded
Count Kourásoff as the general benefactor of the
human race.</p>

<p>The only dissatisfied man in the village appeared
to be the parish priest. The contempt in
which the "White" or married clergy are generally
held is well known, and in this instance the dislike
of the parishioners was warmly reciprocated; but,
in spite of the head-shakings and evident disgust
of my village friends, I had formed a sort of intimacy
with the old fellow, and sometimes amused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
myself by listening to his hearty denunciations of
the souls committed to his charge. Once he said,
shrugging his shoulders: "Count Loris is a man of
sense, but he treats them like rational human beings,
when, to show you how little they deserve it,
about once a year the howling sickness breaks out
among them. It begins with some woman whose
husband has given her an extra beating&mdash;not a
blow too much, I dare say" (the priest was accused
of using this method of persuasion on his
own wife occasionally)&mdash;"and in two days the
whole village is howling."</p>

<p>"Well," I asked, "what happens then?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you. The first time it broke out,
some disguised men&mdash;of course <i>I</i> knew nothing of
it, you understand," said he, opening his eyes and
shutting them again with a cunning look&mdash;"took
seven of these howling devils in the middle of the
night, and, cutting a hole in the ice of the lake,
dipped them in two or three times. One of them&mdash;old
Mother Petroff&mdash;died the next day, but that
was no great loss&mdash;the village has been twice as
peaceable ever since."</p>

<p>"The remedy was severe, but does not appear
to have been effectual," said I.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes! Now, when they begin to be
troublesome&mdash;that is, more troublesome than
women usually are&mdash;some fine morning they see a
big square hole cut in the ice, and they leave off
as suddenly as they began. Women are plagues at
best," he continued after a pause of deep reflection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, little father," said I, still laughing, "if
one wishes a picture of the dark side of Russian
humanity, I know of no one so well fitted to give
it as you."</p>

<p>"I am indeed well acquainted with it in my
own parishioners. St. Nicholas help me to abuse
them!" said he, piously crossing himself.</p>

<p>But there was for me something more interesting
than the village priest or the commune: Count
Kourásoff was seriously contemplating marriage.
He scarcely allowed me time to make my modest
toilet and eat my simple dinner on the day of my
arrival before I was carried off to see his <i>fiancée</i>.
He told me she was Mademoiselle Olga Orviéff,
that she lived at Antokollo,&mdash;one of the two fine
suburbs of Wilna,&mdash;and that she enjoyed a virtual
independence, having as her only companion an old
aunt quite deaf, nearly blind, and totally incapable.</p>

<p>"I suppose," said I on the way to Antokollo,
"that Mademoiselle Orviéff is one of those gentle
creatures with whom life flows&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As placidly as a canal," said my friend.</p>

<p>"I am gratified to hear it," I replied. "In
marriage one needs repose."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Count Loris.</p>

<p>"I imagine, therefore," said I after a pause,
"she is not one of those superficially gifted
women who appear to have minds. Perhaps my
description of my beloved Maria may have inclined
your fancy to the same type; and, while she
embodies my ideas of female excellence, I am sure
she never read a book through in her life."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Olga reads, I fear; but I can
easily break her of that after we are married," said
Count Kourásoff gravely.</p>

<p>"Is she handsome?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"She is not ugly," was his guarded answer.</p>

<p>"The shallowness of women makes them easily
read," said I; "although I speak with diffidence.
My knowledge of them is limited: yours, doubtless,
is extensive."</p>

<p>"Far from it," said he with energy; "the more
I see of them the less I know of them."</p>

<p>"Then what a frightful risk!" I cried. "My
friend, I would not be in your place for the wealth
of the empire."</p>

<p>"But Mademoiselle Olga has such soft eyes
and such dark eyelashes!" said he. "That comforts
me when the recollection of the vagaries of
her sex casts me down. After all, if we marry at
all, we must marry a woman&mdash;the philosophers
give us no escape from <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>"Too true, my friend; but the philosophers bid
us avoid marriage altogether."</p>

<p>"They did not on that account refrain themselves.
However, I escaped until my time came;
which is all that any of us can expect. Destiny
can overtake all of us&mdash;even you, my gay and
youthful professor. But I do assure you that
Mademoiselle Olga has most beautiful eyes."</p>

<p>When at last I was presented to Mademoiselle
Orviéff, I found that she possessed the essence of
beauty&mdash;which is the power to please. Her appearance
was exquisitely feminine, but there was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
fire in her eyes and a curve in her red mouth that
showed a spirit beyond her outward softness and
delicacy. At first I thought her the simplest creature
I had ever met with; but I afterward found
her to be the most complex. This knowledge was
not arrived at in a day, a week, or a month, but in
a long period of familiar intercourse. She was a
beautiful revelation to me; for the first time I
comprehended the charm of a fine intelligence in a
woman. She possessed without knowing it, a cultivated
understanding, but she always appeared to
me, in her serious moments, like a child playing at
being wise. She did me the honor to exert all her
powers of pleasing upon me, while Count Kourásoff
looked on amused at her adroit cajolery of me
and her determined effort to win my good opinion.
She very soon established a remorseless tyranny
over me under cover of the gentlest and most insinuating
manner. I was her "dearest professor,"
her "best of friends," and meantime she held me in
the hollow of her little hand. Her devotion to
Count Kourásoff was of the nature of a religion.
To me, and to all the world but him, she used all
the flattering wiles and pretty artifices that render
women charming, but she seemed to feel by a fine
instinct that she needed but one art with him&mdash;to
be her own true and natural self.</p>

<p>But the destiny to be loved too much and by
too many seemed to be Olga's fate. Among those
whom her evident preference for Count Kourásoff
had not discouraged was General Klapka, commandant
of the garrison at Wilna, and at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
time one of the richest men in Russia. He was a
man at all times unscrupulous and dangerous to
thwart, and a singular complication placed the
power of inflicting a terrible revenge in his hands.
Vladimir Kourásoff was stationed with his regiment
at Wilna under a sort of surveillance, and
General Klapka could add still further to his painful
and perilous position. He had more than once
intimated to Count Loris that he held Vladimir's
life in his hands; and this could be readily believed,
for nothing seemed to impress Vladimir
with a sense of his danger. He openly and bitterly
complained of his banishment from St. Petersburg,
and his conduct showed equal levity and
recklessness.</p>

<p>I was astonished at the tact and boldness with
which Mademoiselle Olga managed so troublesome
and dangerous a lover as General Klapka.
But Count Loris did not seem disposed to aid her.
Whatever anxiety he might feel for Vladimir, he
did not on that account do much toward conciliating
General Klapka on the occasions&mdash;and they
were not infrequent&mdash;when they met at Antokollo.
I made no doubt that each respected the personal
courage of the other, but nothing but my friend's
coolness under all circumstances and unshaken
self-possession foiled General Klapka's evident
efforts to disoblige him.</p>

<p>One day Count Loris proposed that we should
drive over to Antokollo. It was a lovely afternoon
in August, and we went in an open calèche,
which we left at the entrance of the grounds. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
we walked slowly under the rich and dappled shadows
of the beech-trees, we saw a group before us&mdash;General
Klapka and two aides in brilliant uniform,
and Mademoiselle Olga sitting in a rustic
chair lazily fanning herself and holding a gay pink
parasol over her pretty bare head. No better foil
for her youth and loveliness could be imagined
than General Klapka. He was awkward and stout,
with purplish moustaches and a suspiciously black
and luxuriant head of hair. Mademoiselle Olga
always described him as looking like a wild beast;
and he certainly had a sort of savage glare in his
fierce eyes. He did not appear overjoyed to see
us as we made our greetings, but Olga, who had
appeared somewhat bored before noticing our approach,
became all animation.</p>

<p>The two aides, after politely saluting Count
Kourásoff and superciliously surveying my plain
coat, entered into a deeply interesting conversation
with each other. Thereupon Mademoiselle Olga
honored me with her particular notice, and, proposing
a walk around the grounds, coolly took my arm,
leaving Count Loris and General Klapka to pair
off together. The latter, though not deficient in
breeding, did not respond very cordially to Count
Kourásoff's well-bred efforts at a good understanding,
and perhaps felt the contrast between his
companion's graceful figure and his own ungainly
appearance. But whether they got on well or ill
appeared to matter very little to Olga: she left
them to amuse themselves, and chattered on to me
in her pretty and entertaining manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>The grounds were small but beautifully laid
out. We presently came to a bridge over a little
stream, and stopped to watch the water tumbling
over the rocks at the bottom. Olga, leaning carelessly
over the rail, dropped sticks and pebbles
into the water, and ended by dropping her fan&mdash;a
pretty thing of lace and ivory&mdash;after them. Of
course we each offered to save it, but, with a coquettish
imperiousness, she ordered General Klapka
to the rescue. The General, highly gratified,
tucked his military chapeau under his arm, made
his slippery way down the bank, and, stepping
cautiously upon the stones, reached out for the fan.
In vain; it was just a little beyond him.</p>

<p>"A little farther, General Klapka&mdash;only one
step more," cried Olga encouragingly.</p>

<p>"But mademoiselle, the rocks are wet, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah, Mademoiselle Olga, do not tempt General
Klapka too far.&mdash;Beware of another step, General
Klapka!" cried Count Loris, maliciously.</p>

<p>Of course General Klapka took the other step,
but it was of no use; a mischievous eddy carried
the fan still farther down.</p>

<p>"If you will accept of my services&mdash;" began
Count Loris, turning to Olga.</p>

<p>General Klapka raising himself to scowl at his
impertinent rival, just what all of us had foreseen
happened; there was a plunge, a loud splash, and
he was floundering in the water. It was very shallow,
and he was on his feet in a moment, but Count
Loris, with officious politeness, rushed to his rescue,
literally dragging him out, completely drowning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
the general's angry assurances that he did not need
any assistance by protestations of regret and earnest
inquiries whether he had received any hurts.
Meanwhile, Olga, standing on the bank, anxiously
fished for the general's hat, which she triumphantly
landed on the point of her pink parasol.</p>

<p>As soon as he was well out of the water, General
Klapka sent one of his young officers, who
looked as crestfallen as himself, to order their
horses; but, in the little time that elapsed before
his departure, Mademoiselle Orviéff seemed determined,
by her endless regrets and apologies, not to
let him forget his mishap, while, by a singular process
of feminine logic, she taxed Count Kourásoff
with being the sole cause of the accident. He,
after all, had saved the fan, and bore her reproaches
with great coolness. When at last General Klapka,
sulky and discomfited, rode off Mademoiselle Olga
and the count laughed at him as if they would
never tire, and seemed to think his misfortune a
source of boundless amusement; but I began to
see that there were some tragic elements in this
comedy they were playing.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>About this time the Grand Duke Constantine
was expected at Wilna, and great preparations were
made to receive him; but the revolutionary placards
which had appeared there, as in every other
town in the empire, became more numerous and
audacious than ever. The police, as the case has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
always been, showed their boasted efficiency by
arresting numbers of innocent persons, whom they
were subsequently obliged to release; but after
every arrest the placards became more violent and
taunting. Several officers of the garrison, even,
were arrested, but, to my surprise, Vladimir Kourásoff
was not among them. He had suddenly grown
prudent; but I can not say that this change in his
conduct inspired either his brother or myself with
any great confidence. Of one thing we were both
assured, that Vladimir's rash and frivolous character
would prevent his being placed in any post
of responsibility by the revolutionary or any other
party. Count Loris was deeply attached to him,
and Vladimir knew very well that his brother's
means and influence would be freely used to save
him from the consequences of his own wrong-doing.</p>

<p>On the morning of the Grand Duke's expected
arrival the city was alive with threatening cards
posted on the walls of the university, the arsenal,
and other public buildings. Count Loris and myself
paid a visit that morning to Mademoiselle
Orviéff, and then joined a throng of eager and expectant
spectators at the palace gates. Vladimir
too, was there, one of a brilliant group of officers
who were to receive the Grand Duke at the entrance
to the palace. The crowd was excited, but good-natured,
and contained the usual mixture seen in
Russia on such occasions&mdash;priests, moujiks, ladies,
beggars, and police&mdash;all loudly talking about indifferent
things, and below their breath discussing
the boldness of the placards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
"One was torn down in St. Stanislas Street at
eight o'clock, and before nine there were dozens
like it posted all over the town&mdash;on the Cathedral
doors, over the Nikolas bridge, everywhere," said
an officer with whom I was conversing. As he
spoke, I turned and saw Vladimir Kourásoff listening
to him with a conscious smile on his countenance.</p>

<p>At that moment a droschky appeared at the extremity
of the long street which the police kept
clear for the imperial cortége. The horse dashed
furiously along, evidently running away, while the
driver held on desperately to the reins. On the
narrow seat were two moujiks holding on to each
other, apparently drunk and unconscious of their
danger. They kissed each other and rubbed their
beards together, as their habit is in their convivial
moods; but I suspected that they were not drunk,
and perhaps not even moujiks. One of them appeared
to be urging the already maddened horse
still more. "Fly, my dushinka!" ("little darling")
he cried, trying to clutch the reins from the frightened
driver. "Fly like wind and lightning to meet
our good father Constantine!"</p>

<p>His companion waved a box in his hand.
"Fireworks! torpedoes!" he bawled with a yell
of drunken laughter, "for the good Duke Constantine!"</p>

<p>The horse, suddenly swerving from his straight
course, dashed against one of the iron pillars holding
a cluster of lamps at the palace-gate. There
was a loud cry as the crash of the droschky and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the explosion of the box of fireworks occurred at
the same moment, and, while every eye except
mine was apparently fixed on the spot, I saw
Vladimir Kourásoff lift up his hand and affix a
placard to the wall and vanish in the crowd. It
was done in an instant of time.</p>

<p>As I saw it I walked off involuntarily in another
direction, and when I turned and looked
back the throng that had lately been so noisy and
excited was staring in stupid amazement at the
bit of paper securely fastened to the wall.</p>

<p>My first impulse was to seek Count Loris: I
felt that Vladimir's fate was sealed&mdash;that in that
vast multitude some one besides myself must have
seen him. I walked mechanically to the Nikolas
bridge, and, looking up, saw my friend approaching,
and two men, not in uniform, walking slowly
and nonchalantly toward him, immediately in front
of me. We all four met in the middle of the
bridge.</p>

<p>One of the strangers laid his hand lightly on
the count's arm. "In the name of the emperor,"
said he, "your sword."</p>

<p>Count Loris, with a cool smile, unbuckled his
sword and handed it to him. "I am now, and always,
the faithful subject of the emperor's most
sacred Majesty," said he.</p>

<p>The man, who had hitherto remained silent, examining
him carefully, said: "He does not wear
the uniform of Count Vladimir Kourásoff's corps."</p>

<p>"That is easily accounted for," replied his companion:
"he has a brother who is in the Guards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
and a change of uniform is a shallow trick often
resorted to."</p>

<p>"Come, my friends," said Count Loris, smiling
pleasantly, "do not keep a gentleman and a faithful
officer standing here in this piercing wind."</p>

<p>"Come on, then," said one of his captors.
"You have plenty of courage: it is well, for you
will need it all."</p>

<p>"Farewell, my friend!" said Count Loris, turning
to me, and, still smiling, walked off with the
police officers.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>I went to Antokollo, to the house where we
had spent so many happy hours, feeling a kind of
horror at being the bearer of such tidings. The
arrest of Count Kourásoff, in itself a dangerous
thing, became still more so when I reflected that
he would be absolutely in the power of General
Klapka, who, as military governor, had charge of
all the state prisoners. As for Vladimir, I made
no doubt that he would improve this chance to
save his precious self. It would be some hours,
and possibly some days, before it would be found
out that they had not captured the real culprit.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Olga came in, looking gayer and
more brilliant than usual. When I told her of her
lover's misfortune, this tender young creature exhibited
the utmost courage. But when I expressed
my indignation at Vladimir's conduct, she turned
on me like a young lioness: he was Count Kourásoff's
brother, and how dare I so speak of him be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>fore
her? I hastily apologized and added one
more to my list of the incomprehensibilities in
woman's nature. I offered, at any cost, to carry
the assurances of her faithfulness to Count Loris.</p>

<p>"He knows it better than you could tell him,"
she said, looking scornfully at me. But with her
woman's wit she devised a plan by which I could
communicate with my friend.</p>

<p>The next morning I presented myself at General
Klapka's levée, and, having obtained a few
minutes alone with him, I gave him to understand
that I knew the state prisoner Kourásoff was Loris
and not Vladimir, and, explaining that I had an
account which I wished to settle with the former,
I obtained permission to present it. General
Klapka was ready enough to believe me one of
those summer friends who change as seasons
change, and the fact that a state prisoner could
not alienate any of his property did not make it
the less annoying to have claims presented to him.</p>

<p>General Klapka took me to a window, and,
pointing significantly to the fortress where the
prisoners were confined, said: "I have a question
to ask of you. Now, if you attempt to deceive
me, in less than twenty-four hours you will have
an apartment there."</p>

<p>I bowed silently.</p>

<p>"You are probably aware," he continued, "that
I am deeply interested in Mademoiselle Orviéff.
Have you seen her since Kourásoff's arrest?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied; "I saw her immediately afterward."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
"Did she express any fear for him or show any
excitement?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least," said I.</p>

<p>"Did she endeavor to send any message to
Kourásoff by you? Examine your recollection
carefully, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," said I. "I told her I should try to see
him: I candidly acknowledge that I asked her if
she had a message to send, and she declined positively."</p>

<p>He stood gazing thoughtfully on the ground
for a little while. "You may go," he said at length.
"Count Kourásoff has not at present any money
at his disposal"&mdash;he smiled as he spoke&mdash;"but you
may get his promise to pay your principal with interest&mdash;with
good interest. And remember, my
friend, if you suspect that the prisoner is not
Count Vladimir Kourásoff, you will be careful not
to speak of it: you will find it best to observe my&mdash;requests."</p>

<p>The next day, and many days after, I presented
myself at the outer fort where Count Kourásoff
was imprisoned, and, after having been duly
searched and found to carry nothing with me but
a huge account-book showing Count Kourásoff to
be thousands of roubles in debt to me, I was admitted
to his narrow apartment, where we would
sit at a little table and figure and dispute by the
hour. During these apparently stormy interviews,
when a great deal of information was conveyed to
him about Olga as well as public affairs, the sentry
who walked up and down before his open door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
cast many angry looks at me, and always ushered
me out with more haste than civility; for Count
Loris had managed to engage the affections of the
soldiers who guarded him as well as everybody
else's. My parting assurance to him always was
that the mines of Siberia would claim him yet; to
which he would respond by saying that no misfortunes
of his would benefit me or make him pay my
dishonest account.</p>

<p>He had another visitor besides myself. Day
after day a priest, whom I knew to be my friend
at Ivánofka, but who was apparently fifty years
older than in the August before, appeared at General
Klapka's <i>levée</i>. He seemed so old as to be
nearly imbecile; but with singular persistence he
came, always telling some endless tale of the
wrongs he had suffered at the hands of the Kourásoffs,
and always demanding to see the supposed
Vladimir. At last, one day, in a mingled fit of impatience
and unusual good nature, General Klapka
ordered him to be admitted to Count Kourásoff,
where he talked and mumbled so incoherently that
the count appeared unable to understand him and
to be quite worn out with him. However, he continued
to come at intervals, and his stupidity became
a jest for the soldiers of the guard; but
Count Loris understood from his wandering talk
the exact state of affairs at Ivánofka during his
absence.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the city was in a state of excitement
difficult to describe. The arrest of Count
Vladimir Kourásoff, as was supposed, followed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
that of several other officers and members of families
of distinction, created a profound impression;
but the Government seemed in no haste to bring
the prisoners to trial, and they were treated with
extraordinary leniency. There was great surprise
manifested at the disappearance of Count Loris
Kourásoff; but General Klapka did not hesitate
to say that Count Loris knew enough of his brother's
schemes to make his absence convenient, if
not necessary.</p>

<p>All this time General Klapka was more and
more devoted to Mademoiselle Orviéff. She
treated him with an indifference that was not devoid
of coquetry, but he seemed under a spell. I
once asked her if she felt no stings of remorse
when she remembered General Klapka's real and
disinterested affection, however ungenerous he
might be. She gave me a look that was meant to
wither me. "If I would sacrifice myself and all
that I have or could hope for Loris Kourásoff,
do you suppose I would hesitate to sacrifice General
Klapka too?" she said.</p>

<p>"I do not know," I answered dubiously.
"Maria von Spreckeldsen sacrificed me to Herr
Sachs: I know <i>that</i> much."</p>

<p>"Maria von Spreckeldsen!" she said contemptuously;
and clasping her hands behind her back,
like a child saying a puzzling lesson, she came and
stood before me. "Do you mean to say&mdash;do you
really mean to say&mdash;that the sentiment between
you and Maria von Spreckeldsen could be called
<i>love</i>?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Now, I thought this was very unkind of Mademoiselle
Olga, and showed duplicity as well, for
she had always professed the deepest sympathy
for me in regard to my Maria, and a profound belief
in the depth of my feelings.</p>

<p>"Come," said she, blushing, but straightening
up her slim young figure, "do you know that when
one loves as&mdash;as&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As you love Count Kourásoff," I said.</p>

<p>She took his picture from about her neck and
kissed it for answer. "Very well, then; but men
are so dense! You think that I love like that tedious
Maria; General Klapka thinks he can persuade
me to love him; while Count Loris thinks&mdash;I
know not what. My heart is a mystery to every
one of you, and to myself as well. Look what
General Klapka brought me yesterday," she continued,
producing from a cabinet a picture of him,
elaborately set in a small gold frame. She was
clever with her pencil and brush, and she had, with
childish revenge, touched it up so that the general,
who was anything but handsome, looked even uglier
than Nature had made him.</p>

<p>I could not help laughing at the ludicrous
effect, and, while she held it off at arm's length,
she made a contemptuous face at it, besides several
unflattering remarks; but she suddenly threw it
down and burst into sobs and tears; "I sometimes
wonder that I can laugh, for my heart always
aches&mdash;always. I feel that Loris Kourásoff stands
on the brink of an awful fate. That wretch is capable
of anything; he would have him taken out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
and shot any morning that he discovered we still
love each other."</p>

<p>I tried to comfort her, but could not. I too
felt a dreadful uncertainty.</p>

<p>"You may tell Count Loris this for me," she
said, drying her tears, "that I long to see him,
and if I can not see him by lawful means I will see
him by unlawful means. I will conspire."</p>

<p>I repeated this imprudent speech to my friend,
who sent her in return a stern command to put all
thoughts of conspiring for her and for himself out
of her head. I found she had arranged in her
mind a very plausible plan, by which she was to
penetrate to the interior of the fort, and, taking
his place, suffer him to escape; but this fine
scheme was brought to naught by the count's peremptory
orders.</p>

<p>The weeks dragged slowly along. I had begun
to feel even a sort of security for my friend, when
all at once a volcano burst beneath our feet. One
evening, on returning to the modest apartment in
which I had lived in Wilna since Count Kourásoff's
imprisonment, I found awaiting me a gentleman
who politely informed me that my presence was
required at General Klapka's headquarters. I had
little to fear for myself, but I felt an alarm for
those who were so dear to me; and I had lived
long enough in Russia to know that the military
governor of a province can ruin whom he will. I
followed my companion with a composed countenance,
but a sinking heart. Upon reaching the
barracks I was ushered into a small room to await<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
General Klapka's pleasure, my polite captor remaining
with me. To enliven my spirits, he dwelt
upon the horrors of exile.</p>

<p>"But, my friend," I replied, "exile does not
now mean what it did in the time of the Czar Peter.
There are whole villages of prosperous inhabitants
in Siberia, priests, school-masters, clerks,
Government employés, all exiles, only the emperor
prefers them to live in a certain part of his dominions."</p>

<p>"Ah," said he, sighing and shaking his head,
"they are those who acknowledged their guilt and
threw themselves on the mercy of the emperor.
For those who persisted in calling themselves innocent,
the mines&mdash;the railways&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But if I wished to call myself guilty, of what
should I accuse myself? Of trying to get a settlement
of my affairs with Count Kourásoff?" This
view seemed to strike him so forcibly that he left
me to my own sad fancies.</p>

<p>The hours dragged on until nearly midnight,
when I was awakened from a heavy but troubled
sleep before the stove by a messenger from General
Klapka commanding my presence. I followed
my guide to a small anteroom, where I saw the
general at a table in an inner room, reading a
closely-written paper. He motioned me to enter,
and, rising, carefully closed the door after me. He
was simply frightful in his anger. He thrust the
paper at me, and I began to read it; it was a minute
account of Vladimir Kourásoff's escape, of
the true meaning of the visits of the village priest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
and myself to Count Loris, of Olga Orviéff's faithful
devotion to him&mdash;even a copy of a few lines
she had once rashly conveyed to him.</p>

<p>While I was reading, he had taken his sword
from the scabbard, and was passing the naked
blade through his fingers with a sort of murderous
delight. "I have you&mdash;the tool&mdash;and in a few
minutes I shall have the principal," was the only
remark he made to me.</p>

<p>I seemed to have waited hours, when there was
a sudden and peremptory knock at the door. General
Klapka rose and opened it immediately. Two
members of the police and a figure completely enveloped
in a large fur cloak stood outside. "Excellency,
it was the prisoner who knocked so
loudly," began each of the police in a breath; but
General Klapka, motioning the prisoner to enter,
abruptly closed the door.</p>

<p>The room was well lighted, and the person who
entered, walking boldly forward, dropped the
cloak, and Olga Orviéff stood revealed. She was
in a brilliant ball-dress of pale and shining green,
and pearls gleamed softly on her milk-white neck
and arms. She made a profound and graceful
courtesy to General Klapka, adroitly spreading
out her rich train as she did so. "I had not looked
for the pleasure of seeing General Klapka when
only a few moments ago I was unexpectedly called
from the ball," she said with a certain grand air
that she knew very well how to assume; then,
catching sight of me, she suddenly dropped her
stately manner. "You here, my friend?" she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
cried in a tone of laughing familiarity. "Have
you been conspiring too?"</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Orviéff, allow <i>me</i> to claim your
attention first," said General Klapka. I looked
at her to see if his infuriated presence had made
any impression on her. If it had, it was only to
arouse further her fearless spirit. He was still
nervously feeling the edge of his sword. "You
spoke just now of conspiring: conspiring may
bring that white neck of yours into jeopardy,"
said he, looking as if he would like to try the
blade on it.</p>

<p>She drew herself up and arched her proud
neck. "Do <i>you</i> threaten <i>me</i>?" she said with cool
scorn.</p>

<p>For answer he handed her with a low bow the
paper I had read: "Read that, and see if I need to
threaten."</p>

<p>She raised it with an air at once careless and
coquettish, and, after reading a few lines, burst
out laughing. "We are found out," she said, turning
to me, "and General Klapka is vexed, I see,
because I sometimes sent a tender message to my
lover." When she said that, he made a spring at
her which caused me to jump from my chair; but,
instead of recoiling, she advanced two steps toward
him, as he stood before her panting and furious.
"Yes," she said in a clear, high voice, "to
Count Loris Kourásoff."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle, I implore you&mdash;" I began.</p>

<p>"What would you have me do?" she said,
turning contemptuously to me. "If I am in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
power, will anything avail me now? and if I am
not in his power, let me say what I please."</p>

<p>"Yes, say what you please," said General
Klapka in an intense voice: "it will only bring his
destruction a little nearer. If Count&mdash;if that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do not dare to speak Count Kourásoff's
name before me!" she cried.</p>

<p>If a man like General Klapka could be cowed
by anything, he might be said to have quailed
under her voice and presence; she spoke distinctly,
and raised her little hand as she advanced nearer
him. She stopped abruptly and fanned herself.
"Really," she said, "I am losing my temper. You,
General Klapka, appear to have lost yours before I
came."</p>

<p>"Do you know, Mademoiselle Orviéff, what it
is to be secretly communicating with a state prisoner?"
said General Klapka, recovering his coolness
a little.</p>

<p>"And do you know what it is, General Klapka,
to have the discipline of the garrison so lax that a
state prisoner can be communicated with, even
visited, by his friends and," laughing and nodding
her head at me, "his accomplices."</p>

<p>General Klapka could only grind his teeth
and mutter, "Communicating with a state prisoner."</p>

<p>"If I could have obtained Count Kourásoff's
consent," she continued, casting down her eyes
modestly, "I could have entered the fortress, and
with the aid of my friend the village priest have
actually married the man I love. I wish I had!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
she added, suddenly raising her eyes and opening
them wide and bright.</p>

<p>If her object was to exasperate him still further,
she was succeeding admirably, while he had not
been able to intimidate her in the least degree.
"Count Loris Kourásoff's life may pay for that
wish," he said.</p>

<p>"You forget," she replied: "Count Kourásoff
is only under arrest until his identity is established."</p>

<p>"Let him be brought to trial," said he, "and
for a thousand rubles I can prove him to be
Vladimir Kourásoff. You know what the moujiks
say: 'Money can buy vengeance.'"</p>

<p>She turned slightly pale, and he seemed to
gloat over this her first sign of discomfiture,
when at that moment there was a loud commotion
in the outer apartment and a vehement knock at
the door. "Open! open!" cried a dozen eager
voices.</p>

<p>When General Klapka opened the door, Vladimir
Kourásoff walked in. He was haggard and
unshorn&mdash;a piteous contrast to the handsome and
dashing officer he had once been. "I surrender myself,"
said he to General Klapka. "I am Count Vladimir
Kourásoff. I was in Geneva, safe, when I heard
of my brother's arrest. I could not but come back."
There was a deep pause. Vladimir continued in
a collected manner: "I expected to find my brother
exiled at the very least, but when I heard that he
was still imprisoned here I communicated with
some of his friends in St. Petersburg, who brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
the matter before the emperor, and they have his
personal guaranty that if I surrender myself my
brother shall be immediately released."</p>

<p>I confess I never expected anything so noble
or magnanimous from Vladimir. I sat in speechless
astonishment; General Klapka stared stupidly
at him like a man in a dream; while Olga began
to weep, clinging to Vladimir.</p>

<p>The next morning it was all over Wilna that
Vladimir had surrendered himself, and that a telegram
had been received from St. Petersburg ordering
Count Loris to be set at liberty, but to remain
in the city on a sort of honorable parole until
the trial of the prisoners came off.</p>

<p>A crowd of his friends and well-wishers, and
the multitude of idlers whom such occasions always
collect, assembled at the prison-gates in the
early afternoon to see him brought forth. My
friend the village priest and myself stood next the
gate.</p>

<p>"There are the two who so cruelly tormented
Count Kourásoff during his captivity," began to
be whispered around. Taunts and epithets were
freely bestowed upon us, which soon changed to
open-mouthed wonder; for when the great gates
clanged wide open, and Count Loris with uncovered
head walked forward, we were the first he
saluted and embraced.</p>

<p>Vladimir escaped with a sentence of only seven
years' exile, which, through his own good conduct
and his brother's influence, was considerably shortened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Sometimes when I behold the happiness of the
Count and Countess Kourásoff, I say to myself
with a sigh. "This ideal life might have been
mine with my adored Maria!"</p>

<h2 id="COLONEL">A VIRGINIA COLONEL.</h2></div>


<p>The colonel was a regular old-time Virginia
colonel, and still stuck manfully to his blue coat
and brass buttons and his buff nankeen waistcoat,
in which quaint costume his clean, handsome, ruddy
old face never looked handsomer. "Buff and blue
is the costume for gentlemen to wear," the colonel
would roar; and whatever he said, Yellow Bob
echoed like a Greek chorus. "Yes, siree; dat sut'ny
is so. <i>I</i> got a blue coat ole marse done gimme."
The colonel's clinging to old days and old ways
was pathetic. Although he swore forty times a day
that the war had ruined him, it had not. There was
enough left for the colonel and madam and the colony
of their old servants, which, as the case frequently
is to this day in Virginia, had settled around
them. The colonel still had Yellow Bob to swear
at, and Mrs. Randolph had Patsy to carry the keys
and make mango pickle and peach cordial. But
the age had swept them high and dry. They talked
about things chiefly that happened in the 'fifties,
and when they got into the 'sixties the colonel was
apt to damn the Yankees so profusely that Mrs.
Randolph was fain to ask him if he remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the trip they took to the Springs in 'forty-nine,
when his pocket was picked of nine hundred and
eighty dollars; at which the colonel and Yellow
Bob would exchange winks. Yellow Bob knew
that a race between Colonel Doswell's strawberry
roan and Major Beverly's Sir Archy had more to
do with the loss of that nine hundred and eighty
dollars than Mrs. Randolph&mdash;good, simple soul&mdash;suspected.
As for the colonel, the war did not
make so much difference to him as he fancied. He
now spent the best part of his life sitting on the
broad front porch at Drum Point, with a julep
handy and Yellow Bob within swearing distance,
and for gentlemen of seventy-five, of the colonel's
temperament, there is not much else to do. Horse-racing
he regarded as out of the question, because
he no longer had nine hundred and eighty dollars
to throw away on it whenever he fancied. The
colonel believed that the present age was utterly
tame and devoid of incident, and loudly lamented
that happy, bygone time, when duels, runaway
matches, racing, betting, and other gentlemanly
amusements were more in favor than at present.</p>

<p>"Damme, sir," cried the Colonel, fretfully,
"nothing happens now; the young folks don't even
run away and get married. A fellow calls another
fellow a liar, and&mdash;dog my cats!&mdash;the other fellow
goes and sues him in the courts, instead of shooting
him down in his tracks. Did you ever hear of
Jack Thornton? Now that man had some adventures,
sir, in this very county, sir, that ought to be
written in a book."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Yellow Bob here took up the conversation.
"Books is fur white folks&mdash;dat's what I say. Dese
here fool niggers gwine 'long de road ter school
wid dey spellin'-books is mighty disqualifyin' ter
me. Unc' Isaac Minkins he k'yarn git up and
preach 'dout a gret big hymn-book in he hand fur
to read de Bible outen."</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, you rascal!" bawled the
colonel, highly pleased nevertheless. "The infernal
free-school system, sir, and the unjustifiable
application of steam to machinery, has been the
ruin of this country. As I was telling you, though,
about Jack Thornton; his land joined mine, and
we were at William and Mary together. Well, Jack
was as handsome a fellow as ever stepped, and the
only man in the county that could beat me after
the hounds. He had a very pretty property too,
sir, and as likely a lot of negroes as there was in
the county, and there was eleven hundred acres in
the tract at Northend. By Jove! what jolly bachelor
dinners he used to give there! Eh, Bob? I
got mighty near being kicked by the madam for a
little turn about we had at one of those dinners.
That dinner, sir, lasted three days, and I rode my
horse up the front stairs into Jack's bedroom.
Ah, they were days!"</p>

<p>"An' missis&mdash;she was Miss Sally Ambler den&mdash;she
meet me in de road when I was k'yarin' ole
marse home in de chaise, an' he k'yarn say a word.
And I say: 'Sarvint, missis. Marse, he mighty
sick; I feerd he ain't gwi' live twell de doctor git
ter him.' And Miss Sally she bust out cryin' and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
jump off'n her horse, and come ter de chaise an'
look in marse's face. An' he 'gin ter holler an'
say: 'I ain't sick, my dear; I'm drunk as a lord&mdash;hic.
An' ef you knew how jolly I feel, you'd
go an' git drunk yerself.' Missis she turn away,
an'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Zounds, sir! do you propose to tell the secrets
of my life, you yellow scoundrel? But it's
true. I had a hard time bringing the madam
round, and by the Lord I don't believe I'd have
done it at all but for Jack Thornton. He swore
he had made me tight, when, ha! ha! ha! I could
drink him under the table any day in the week.
The madam believed Jack, thank God! though.
Well, as I was telling you, there were some monstrous
exciting things in Jack's life. First, after
he had settled down to live like a gentleman at
Northend, old Smithers got his note for ten thousand
dollars to pay some debts of honor Jack had
made; and then the doggoned interest began
piling up, and the black measles broke out among
his negroes, and he lost nearly half of them, and
we had a drought two years in succession, and the
first thing I knew Jack was a bankrupt. Old Scaife
Beverly, Jack's uncle, was as rich as a Jew, and
had thousands of dollars in his secretary; but the
old skinflint said something or other about Jack's
squandering his patrimony, and Jack swore he'd
see the old rascal at Davy Jones's before he'd take
a cent from him; so there he was, strapped and
stranded. Well, about that time there was an election
for sheriff, and Jack came to me and consulted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
me about his running for sheriff, and I told him
he couldn't do better; and the fact was, if he
didn't get hold of some ready money he'd have to
sell his negroes, and that was what he mortally
hated, of course. So the next court day" (the
colonel pronounced it cote day) "he announced
himself as a candidate. I made a speech myself
on the court-house green, calling upon the gentlemen
of the county to support him. I was always
counted a good speaker, sir, when I was in the
House of Delegates."</p>

<p>"An' ole missus she was allers a mighty good
han' at writin' o' de speeches," chimed in Yellow
Bob.</p>

<p>"You bandy-legged rascal," shouted the Colonel,
angrily, turning very red, "I've a great mind
to kick you off this plantation, as I've had every
day for forty odd years."</p>

<p>Here Bob created a diversion. "Dat sut'ny
was a good speech you made fur Marse Jack. Missis
she was in Richmon' when dat speech was
spoke. De folks dey holler an' whoop, an' Marse
Jack Thornton he came up an' shooken old Marse's
han' and says, 'Ef I'm 'lected, I'll owe it to you,
Kun'l.'"</p>

<p>"So he did&mdash;so he did," said the Colonel, somewhat
mollified. "But still 'twas very surprising to
see Jack Thornton performing the sheriff's duties&mdash;and
he had no deputy either. I was mightily
afraid he'd hurt his chances with Virginia Berkeley;
and so it did, because Virginia turned around
and married Miles Corbin about the time Jack was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
elected. However, I couldn't blame her very
much. She was only seventeen, and Jack was too
proud to go to Colonel Berkeley's house after he
had lost pretty near everything; and Virginia afterward
confessed to the madam that she married
Miles Corbin as much to spite Jack as to please
her father. Corbin was worth every cent of two
hundred thousand dollars, and was a mighty prim,
proper fellow; never touched a card, didn't get
drunk occasionally like a good fellow; but for all
his straight-laced ways he had a devil of a temper.
He used to whip his negroes and then hand round
the plate in church. Damme, sir, if I didn't button
up my breeches' pocket and look him square in
the eye whenever he handed his infernal plate to
me; and communion Sundays, when I went up to
the rail with madam, I made him stand out of my
way, sir, with as little ceremony as if he'd been a
poodle dog. As for Virginia Berkeley, she was a
girl of tremendous spirit, and she led Miles Corbin
a dance, I'm happy to say. She was pretty as a
picture, too; wasn't she, Bob?"</p>

<p>"Pretty!" echoed Yellow Bob&mdash;"she was the
prettiest 'oman ever I seed, scusin' 'twas missis
when she was fust married. Miss Ferginny, she
had black eyes dat f'yarly bu'n a hole in you when
she look at you. She had the leetlest foot an'
han', an' when she laugh, de dimples come out all
over her face."</p>

<p>"That's so; and her mouth&mdash;God bless me!
Well, everybody knew that she and Miles Corbin
wouldn't pull in harness together, and of course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
they quarreled like the devil. Virginia was a
thorough-bred, and she held her head up high; but
sometimes, the madam says, Virginia would come
over here and cry as if her heart would break.
And the madam soon found out that Jack Thornton
was the reason of it. I don't think Virginia
ever tried to get along with Corbin, although God
knows no woman could have done it; but they
hadn't been married a month before they had it
hot and heavy."</p>

<p>"Ole Unc' Snake-root Jim say she throwed a
kittle of bilin' water at him fust time he cuss her.
Maybe dat's what dey calls hot and heavy," remarked
Bob.</p>

<p>"Anyhow ugly stories began to get out about
the way things were going at Corbin Hall. Jack
Thornton never went there, and kept out of Virginia
Corbin's way as much as he could; besides,
he spent all his time nearly riding over the country
on sheriff's duty. He told madam if he hadn't
been elected sheriff, and had to keep on the move,
he'd have blown his brains out sitting down and
doing nothing at Northend, and thinking about
Virginia Corbin and her misery. Queer fellow in
some ways, Jack was. Seemed to like work after
he got used to it. Anyway it began to be talked
about that Miles Corbin&mdash;the sanctimonious devil&mdash;had
struck Virginia Berkeley more than once.
Some people did not believe it, because when they
first began to disagree, Virginia had been heard to
say that if Miles ever laid his hand on her she'd
kill him&mdash;and she would have done it, too. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Berkeleys are that kind, though I must say that
when Virginia had her own way she was as amiable
as anybody I ever saw, and if Miles Corbin had
treated her right she would have made him a good
wife. But she was one that couldn't stand whip
and spur. It happened, though, that Jack Thornton
one night, coming home from court, found one
of Corbin's servants lying at the lane gate of Corbin
Hall with a broken leg. So although he had
sworn he'd never darken Miles Corbin's doors, yet
he had to take the fellow up in his gig and drive
up to Corbin Hall. It was about eleven o'clock
at night, and the negroes had all gone to bed, but
there was a light in the house and a commotion
going on. The dogs started too, but Jack soon
stopped them&mdash;I never saw a dog in my life that
wouldn't fawn on handsome Jack&mdash;when, as he
told me afterward, the hall door flew open, and
Virginia Corbin rushed out and almost into Jack
Thornton's arms. Miles Corbin was right after
her with his fist doubled up. Jack says he was so
dumbfounded his head reeled, but he heard Miles
order her to come back into the house. Then
Virginia straightened herself up and said, "I'll
come back, because I'm not afraid of you; but I
want to tell you now that if ever you raise your
hand against me I'll kill you as surely as I live.
You've never driven me to much&mdash;I've submitted
and waited and hated&mdash;but a very little more will
drive me to murder." Then from somewhere in her
dress she pulled out a pistol. "Do you see this?
Well, I got it for just such an emergency as may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
happen. Jack Thornton, do you hear me?" At
this Jack jumped at Corbin, and catching him by
the collar, walloped him until Corbin yelled. But
he didn't stop for that; he laid it on as long as
he could stand it, and then kicked Corbin all over
the porch. The darky with the broken leg began
to holler, and that brought all the other negroes
trooping out; and at least forty of them saw the
trouncing. And then Virginia showed them the
pistol, and told them what she meant to do if he
ever struck her again. Well, it was hushed up as
far as possible. Virginia was the proudest woman
I ever saw; and she asked Jack to keep it quiet.
And so, while everybody knew that she and Miles
Corbin had had a big flare-up, nobody exactly
knew the circumstances. Virginia didn't even tell
the madam.</p>

<p>"So things went on for a year or two, until one
night I was waked by hearing that lazy yellow
fellow yonder tapping at my window. He had
been to Corbin Hall courting a black girl over
there, when Corbin died&mdash;for he died from a pistol
wound."</p>

<p>"I had jes' done tell Ma'y Jane&mdash;um! she <i>were</i>
a gal&mdash;good-night," said Yellow Bob, taking up
the thread of the story, "an' I was comin' through
de front yard, when I see de lights bu'nin' in de
parlor, an' heerd Marse Miles Corbin a-yellin' at
Miss Ferginny. I was skeered ter go 'way an'
skeered ter stay; but pres'n'y I hear her scream,
an' I run in, an' d'yar was Marse Miles layin' on
de sofa wid de blood po'in' from he hade. Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Ferginny she stan' up lookin' mighty cur'us, wid
a smokin' pistol in her han'. Marse Miles he
groan, but seem like Miss Ferginny didn't hear
'im. I run an' fotch him a piller, an' gin him some
water, an' den I tuck out ter de quarters ter raise
de black folks an' de overseer. Dey all come
runnin'. De overseer he was de po'est kin' of po'
white trash. He jes' come right out in cote an'
tole ev'ything he see dat night; an' de black folks
dey all stan' up for Miss Ferginny, an' 'low dey
didn't see nuttin' 'tall."</p>

<p>"That's so," said the colonel; "for Virginia
Berkeley had to stand up in the prisoner's dock,
and every negro on the land swore they hadn't
seen a pistol, hadn't heard a quarrel, didn't know
anything about it, and that Virginia was the best
mistress in the world. When I got there that
night Miles Corbin was dead, the low-lived dog!
Virginia met me and the madam. 'I didn't kill
him,' she said, as quiet as you please, 'although I
meant to do it. He struck me, and I went and
got the pistol. He got it from me, and went to
the table to withdraw the load, when he got nervous&mdash;he
always was a coward&mdash;and it went off.'
Madam looked at her. 'Has he ever really beaten
you?' she asked. For answer Virginia laughed a
dreadful kind of a laugh, and, pulling up her
sleeve, showed her the marks of Corbin's fingers.
'Look here!' she said, showing her a great bruise
on her shoulder-blade. Madam just burst out crying,
and put her arms around Virginia. 'Thank
God,' she said, 'you didn't kill him!' You can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
just imagine the commotion it raised; but everything
would have been settled at the inquest if it
hadn't been for that dog of an overseer. He and
Miles Corbin had been associates. A gentleman
associating with his overseer! And Mrs. Corbin
had ordered him out of her drawing-room not long
before; so he owed her a grudge, and he paid it.
Such a talk and hubbub was raised that at the next
county court the grand jury returned a true bill
against Virginia Berkeley Corbin for the murder
of her husband. By George!" said the colonel,
pausing to wipe his forehead. "As for Jack
Thornton, he nearly went crazy. At first he said
he'd resign the shrievalty, or kill himself, before
he'd serve the summons on her. She was staying
here where madam had brought her the night
Miles Corbin died. But the Board of Magistrates&mdash;we
didn't have a tuppence-ha'penny county court
then, but gentlemen served as magistrates&mdash;the
board sent for him, and reasoned about the trouble
and expense he'd put the county to if he resigned
that way without notice; and Mrs. Corbin sent
him word that the greatest service he could do her
was to remain in office until after the trial was
over. So at last he consented, but I thought he'd
die the day he served the writ on her."</p>

<p>The colonel paused again, confronted by the
dead and gone tragedy.</p>

<p>"Good Gord A'mighty!" said Yellow Bob,
slowly and solemnly. "I 'member dat day, an' I
gwi' 'member it twell judgment day. 'Twas 'bout
time de fish bite in June. Missis didn't 'ten' ter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
de chickens er de cows er nuttin' den. She was
all time projeckin' wid Miss Ferginny. Seem like
she didn't keer whe'r de tuckey aigs hatch, er de
cows give milk, er de 'taters come up in de g'yarden,
she was so tooken up wid Miss Ferginny.
When Marse Jack Thornton rid up in de yard dat
day I never see a man look like him. He was de
color of a ash-cake 'fo' de ashes is washed off.
Miss Ferginny she was settin' on de po'ch wid ole
marse an' missis when he come up de steps. When
he come to'ds her he stop an' look like he gwi'
drop. An' ole marse, he go up ter him, an' missis,
an' den Miss Ferginny she walk to'ds him an' hol'
out her han'."</p>

<p>Another long pause came.</p>

<p>"I dunno what she say, but ole marse help him
fin' a paper, an' he show it ter 'em, an' dey all git
in de big kerridge an' go up ter de cote-house.
An' I set on de boot wid Unc' Torm Driver, an'
Patsy she rid on de place fur de trunk behin'.
Missis and Miss Ferginny was inside, an' ole marse
he rid horseback wid Marse Jack Thornton."</p>

<p>"They bailed her to appear at the next term of
the circuit court," said the colonel, whose turn it
was now to tell the story; "and half the county
was there to ask the honor of going on her bond.
But she only took me and her counsel, Mr. Severn.
You see everybody knew she was innocent, and
that it was only the malice of that villain of an
overseer to get even with her. And the county
gentry hated Miles Corbin like the devil, and all of
'em sympathized with his wife. The Board of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Magistrates rose when she entered; and when she
left the court-room, and when she went down to
get in my carriage, with me on one side of her and
madam on the other, the magistrates had got out
by a shorter way, and were bowing on each side
of the carriage door. The presiding magistrate,
in the name of the others, expressed their regrets
that they were unable to go on her bail-piece, and
when she drove out of the village, sitting up
straight in my carriage, and looking like a queen,
every man she met took off his hat to her, because,
you see, Virginia Berkeley was a lady, and Miles
Corbin was the damnedest villain&mdash;" Here the
colonel went off into a roaring hurricane of profanity,
which somehow didn't sound profane, but
rather as a kind of cordial emphasis to what he
said.</p>

<p>"She stayed here until the trial came off. Of
course she didn't see anybody, but the whole
county called on her. Dang me, but I believe they
were sorry she hadn't killed Miles Corbin after all;
he deserved it, the dog! The day of the trial the
madam and I took her up to the cote-house&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An' I rid on de boot wid Unc' Torm Driver,
an' Patsy she sat on de place fur de trunk behin',
an' ole marse rid on horseback with Marse Jack
Thornton," echoed Bob the parrot.</p>

<p>"When we got to the cote-house you never saw
such a crowd in your life. We got Virginia in the
cote-room as quietly as we could, and the madam
and I sat by her. And when she was asked&mdash;'Virginia
Corbin, what say you, guilty or not guilty?'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
she stood up as brave as a lion, and says, just as
cool as you please, holding up her little hand,
'Not guilty.' The people yelled for half an hour,
and the Court didn't say a word, and you may be
sure the sheriff didn't.</p>

<p>"The overseer, Higgins, had tried to get a
lawyer to help the prosecuting attorney, but he
couldn't do it, and the prosecuting attorney, I tell
you, had to be very careful what he said. The
first witness they put on the stand was Higgins.
He told a mighty straight story. He told of the
quarrels between Miles Corbin and his wife, and
the threats he had heard her make of killing Corbin
if he continued to strike her. Then he told
about my Yellow Bob waking him up in the middle
of the night, and of his going up to the house
and seeing Miles lying on the sofa dying, and
Miles saying, 'My wife did this.' At this there
was such a thundering row in the court-house that
the Court was obliged to demand order. But Mrs.
Corbin remarked, out loud: 'That is true. He lied
about me with his last breath.' Then the overseer
identified the pistol as the one he had seen in Mrs.
Corbin's hands, and saw on the drawing-room table
on the night of Miles Corbin's death. And altogether
it made a bad showing.</p>

<p>"Yellow Bob was the next witness called for
the prosecution. It was rich testimony&mdash;ha!
ha! ha!"</p>

<p>Yellow Bob chuckled gleefully over the recollection.
"Ev'ything dat ar persecutin' retorney
ask me, I say 'Naw.' 'Did you seen Mr. Miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Corbin on de sofa?' 'Naw, sah.' 'You waked
Higgins up at the overseer's house about midnight?'
'Naw, sir.' 'But Mr. Higgins says you
did?' 'Mr. Higgins, he ain't nuttin' but po' white
trash. I doan' keer what he say. I doan' know
nuttin' 'tall 'bout Marse Miles Corbin dyin'.
May be he had de ager, an' he nose bleed, an' he
bleed hisself ter de'f.' 'No, he didn't have any
ager. He was killed with the pistol.' 'Well, den,'
I say, 'may be Mr. Higgins kilt him.' De jedge
larf at dat. 'But,' said the persecutin' retorney,
'all the black folks seen you. They'll swear to it.'
'Well, bring 'em up heah, an' ef dey swar I d'yar
dat night, I kin swar jes' as hard I warn't.
Dem wuffless black niggers ain't a-gwine ter disencourage
me. Dem Corbin niggers allers was
mighty wuffless and lyin'. Dey done took a heap
o' corn outen our corn-house.' 'Come, now,' says
the persecutin' retorney, 'of course you were there
the night Mr. Corbin died. You gave the alarm.'
'I didn't give 'em no sech a thing, I ain't got no
'larm ter give. I wish I hedn't tole 'em nuttin'
'tall 'bout it,' I say, an' den de persecutin' retorney
he say, 'Now you admit you were there.'
'Naw, I 'ain't remit it;' I say; 'I doan know nuttin'
but dat Mr. Higgins over yander is de meanest
white man gwine, an' Miss Ferginny, she an' missis
is mighty thick; an' ef she warn't de right kin' o'
'oman my missis wouldn't hev nuttin' 'tall fur ter
do wid her; an' dem black niggers kin swar all
dey wants dey seed me. I ain't cipherin' 'bout
dem.' Den de persecutin' retorney he say, 'I can't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
manage the witness,' and I jes' walk right outen de
box dey put me in, an' when I pass Miss Ferginny,
I say, 'Sarvint, mistis.'"</p>

<p>The old colonel laughed uproariously during
the recital.</p>

<p>"And all the Corbin negroes&mdash;they had about
forty of them up as witnesses&mdash;gave about the
same kind of testimony that my Bob did. None
of them knew anything, or had seen anything, or
could be induced to tell anything but lies; and
such lies! Every one of 'em, going out of the
witness box, would pull his wool and duck his
head to Virginia; she certainly had made those
black people love her, and more than one of her
fights with Corbin had been about his shameful
treatment of his negroes. Severn&mdash;he's a first-class
lawyer&mdash;he didn't cross-examine any of them.
He said, 'May it please the Court, I have but one
witness, and that is the prisoner herself. I desire
to put her on the stand that she may tell her own
story.' So he gave her his arm and led Mrs. Corbin
to the witness box, where she sat down in a
chair. You could have heard a pin drop. At first
she looked around her with a sort of dazed look;
it was so pitiful, I saw the foreman of the jury
look away while he wiped the tears from his eyes.
Everybody waited until she came to herself like.
Then she began, in a low voice, to tell it all. She
looked as pale as a sheet until she got to where he
struck her for the first time. Then the blood
poured to her face. 'I don't know how I felt,'
said she; 'I wanted to kill him&mdash;that was all. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
rushed away from him, and then I turned on him.
He began to back when he saw me advance. I
told him that I would get a pistol, and if he
struck me again I would shoot him. Afterward I
thought I had been to blame. I determined I
would try and get along better with him. I endured
that man Higgins in my house&mdash;I endured,
O God! what did I not endure! and it was the
same. He would seize me by the throat and choke
me. That was dreadful, but it wasn't a blow. At
last he struck me that other time when Mr. Thornton
came and beat him.' At that there was going
to be the devil of a row&mdash;the people hurrahing
for Thornton; but Jack checked the disturbance
right away. 'Then,' she said, after everything
was quiet, 'I felt that it would soon be over,
one way or another; either he would kill me or I
would kill him. On the night he died he said that
the man Higgins should dine at Corbin Hall the
next day, and I should appear at the table. I replied
that I would not. He lifted his hand against
me, and I asked him if he remembered what Mr.
Thornton had done to him for that. Then he said&mdash;but
I can't repeat what he said; it was about
Mr. Thornton. I went to the bookcase and got
out my pistol. "You may <i>say</i> what you like," I
said, "but don't touch me." After more words he
came toward me and struck me hard on my shoulder&mdash;here.
At first the pain stunned me. I held
the pistol in my hand. He got it from me; I
could not resist with one arm. He said he would
guarantee his life for that one night, and standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
by the table started to unload it. All at once I
heard it go off, and he staggered to the sofa. I
don't remember anything else until Colonel Randolph
came.'</p>

<p>"When she stopped it was as still as the grave.
Severn had just said something about the other
side asking any questions they pleased, when the
foreman of the jury talked a minute or two to the
judge, and then, nodding to the jurymen, rose up
and said, 'The unanimous opinion of this jury is
that the prisoner is not guilty.' Such a shout!
Mrs. Corbin stood up for a minute, and then, without
a word, fell over in a dead faint in Jack Thornton's
arms. The crowd made way for him as he
carried her, as if she had been a baby, out into the
court-house yard. The madam and I were there
about as soon as he."</p>

<p>"An' me an' Patsy," added Yellow Bob.</p>

<p>"We put her in the carriage&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An' Unc' Torm Driver he lash he horses twell
dey gallop ev'y foot o' de way home."</p>

<p>"Hold your infernal tongue! I'm telling this
story. When we got her home, of course the reaction
set in. She had been as brave as a lion all
the time before, but now she couldn't hold up her
head. She just lay on the bed up-stairs, with her
great black eyes staring out of her white face, and
by George, sir, I thought she was certain to kick
the bucket. The only thing that roused her was
when old Scaife Beverly, Jack's uncle, died without
a will, and Jack got every cent the old curmudgeon
left. Jack had hung around here ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
since Mrs. Corbin came, but she wouldn't see him,
and so months and months went on. At last one
evening when she was well enough to sit up&mdash;it
was more than a year after the trial&mdash;she was
sitting in the chamber there by the dining-room,
looking devilish pretty in a white wrapper,
when&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I seen Marse Jack comin', and I run round de
house an' tole him fur Gord A'mighty's sake ter
run in missis's chamber, kase I was feerd Miss Ferginny
Corbin had done had a fit er sumpin. Co'se
she didn't have no fit; I jes' say it ter git him in
d'yar, an' he jump through de winder openin' on de
po'ch, and when he see her he say, kinder solemn,
'Ferginny!' I never will forgit de way he
say 'Ferginny.' 'Twas jes' same as if he'd tole
her, 'I loves you better'n anything in de whole
wide worl'.' An' Miss Ferginny she fall back in
her cheer, an' she begin ter cry, and say, 'Don't!
don't! I'm too wicked to live!' when Marse Jack
he just tooken her in he arms an' kiss her. I got
so intrusted wid dem conjurements I jes' stan'
like I done tooken root and look in de winder
twell arf' while Marse Jack seen me, an' he pick up
ole marse's boot-jack layin' on de flo' an' shy it at
me. I dodge, an' it broke missis's lookin'-glass an'
her big red berangium in de flower-pot. He gin
me a dollar naix day, an' missis she quile wid him
'bout breakin' her lookin'-glass." Then the colonel
took his turn.</p>

<p>"They wanted to go away from the county, but
I told them they'd better stay where they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
known. It could be lived down sooner here than
anywhere else. Upon my soul they were the most
devoted married couple I ever saw. But the
Thorntons were short-lived people, and Jack died
at forty. That killed Virginia. She never held up
her head afterward. I don't think she lived six
months. The madam said it was better she should
die than live. They had no children. And a lot
of damned, thrifty, industrious Yankees bought
Northend, and they've got a confounded steam-plow
that frightens all my horses, and they raise
hay all over the place, and they've built an infernal
ice-house on top of the ground instead of under it,
and they work the whole place with twenty hands
instead of sixty, as Jack Thornton did, and make
more money than all the rest of the county put
together, and I want a julep&mdash;d'ye hear, you yellow
rascal?"</p>

<h2 id="BROTHERS">THE VALBELLA BROTHERS.</h2></div>


<p>It isn't necessary for me to tell how I drifted
into the burnt-cork profession, but I tell you, after
my preliminary experience of life without burnt
cork, I was glad enough when I could march up
to the manager's office and get my fifteen dollars
a week for amusing my masters, the public. And
I was always in such a hurry to get my money&mdash;we
were paid Saturday night, after the performance&mdash;that
I didn't wait to wash the burnt cork
off before dropping in for the three five-dollar
notes which I was certain to get; for old Sam
Stacker, God bless him! was full of cranks, and
always had a particular way of paying us.</p>

<p>Now I can't say I was a brilliant performer. I
never reached the dignity of interlocutor, to say
nothing of the envied height of Bones or the end
man. I just stood a good way back, and pretended
to play on the 'cello&mdash;I couldn't play a
note, and was nothing but a dummy, but I could
sing pretty well. I remember how when I came
to the front I used to bring the house down with
"The Nightingale." I was great on sentimental
songs. Sam Stacker used to say I was a good all-round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
man. I was quick at figures&mdash;Sam wasn't&mdash;and
I helped him out in his accounts. Then I
could talk to the theatre managers and write them
letters. I had had some education and bringing
up in my pre-Sam Stacker days, and so somehow
I stayed on with the company, and saw it expand
from a small variety show into a first-class minstrel
performance, and old Sam always said it never
would have come to that if it hadn't been for me.
Of course my salary was raised after a while, and
I got to putting some of it away for a rainy day.</p>

<p>Well, as I said, except as a singer, I wasn't
good for much at first, but after a while I got to
singing first-rate. I took a few lessons now and
then, and I learned to sing falsetto. I was boyish
looking, although I was twenty-five years old,
and I used to come out dressed in a low-necked
pink silk gown, with my hair all curled up, and a
bunch of puffs on the top of my head and a fan in
my hand, and sing Il Bacio and the Magnetic
Waltz, as well as plenty of women concert singers,
so the people said. Those curls, though, on the
top of my head, used to bother me dreadfully. It
took Sam and me a good quarter of an hour to get
them in place, and Sam invariably swore like a
pirate during the operation. All the time I was
singing I was thinking about my back hair.</p>

<p>For a long time a notion had been in my head
to bring out something original in the show. All
minstrel shows are alike, and I couldn't for the
life of me hit on anything that Sam Stacker didn't
say, "Oh, I seen that down in Tennessee in '58," or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
"That there thing was introduced in New Orleens
along about '61," or something discouraging of the
kind. At last I did hit upon something. It's old
enough now, but it was new then.</p>

<p>The first thing I wanted to find was a fellow
about my size and general appearance. He wasn't
easy to find. Some of them were as tall as I, but
too broad; some were just my shape, but too tall.
At last I found him. He was pretty nearly my
double by the time we had made up alike. He was
exactly five feet seven&mdash;my height to a dot&mdash;and
we were the same shape and size, and the calves
of our legs looked as if we were twin brothers.
This was a great point, because it was very important
that our legs should resemble each other&mdash;and
the resemblance was startling. Sometimes
I could hardly tell which pair belonged to him and
which to me, but it was all one, as they were both
remarkably fine-looking pairs of legs, particularly
in white silk tights and red silk stockings.</p>

<p>He was a pleasant fellow, too. His first name
was Ted, and mine was Ned; our last names are
unimportant&mdash;no matter about mine certainly&mdash;and
we were advertised in the bills as</p>

<p class="p2 center">THE GREAT VALBELLA BROTHERS!!!<br />
<span class="smcap">Unequaled&nbsp;Gymnasts!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Exquisite&nbsp;Clog&nbsp;Dancers!</span></p>

<p class="p2">and a great deal else, which isn't worth putting
down here. We certainly made a sensation the
first night we appeared in our great specialty. It
was in a big opera house, and every seat was filled;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
and immediately after the first part, "by the whole
company," in which Ted and I had stood in the
background, I sawing away on the big 'cello with
a stop on it, and Ted making believe to blow the
clarionet, both of us joining in the singing as occasion
required, our turn came to appear.</p>

<p>We had rehearsed pretty well, and when the
big curtain rolled up, and Ted and I bounded out
on the stage dressed in a kind of jockey costume&mdash;white
silk tights with red silk stockings, blue
satin shirts with jockey caps of blue and red, and
jockeys' whips in our hands&mdash;we both felt pretty
cool. Then we began our clog dance. It was the
finest kind of clog dancing, I will say, although I
did part of it myself, and then we introduced a
new feature, singing while the clogs rattled on the
floor, and every muscle moving alike. Of course
it took&mdash;the singing as much as the dancing&mdash;and
the people hurrahed and clapped and shouted, and
wouldn't leave off until we had gone over it three
times, and the end man had come on the stage and
asked permission for the other performers to go
home and go to bed, as the audience seemed fully
satisfied with the Valbella Brothers. Then they
laughed, and we got back to our dressing-room,
when old Sam Stacker stood ready to hug us
both.</p>

<p>But it was at the last scene that our really
great performance came off. I had a pretty hard
time making Sam Stacker agree to the expense for
this act, but as we were playing a two weeks' engagement,
I finally bullied him into it. It re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>quired
cutting away some of the flies temporarily,
and putting in a twenty-foot-square skylight over
the stage. This skylight opened in two sections,
and after our second appearance, more clog dancing
and more scientific ground-tumbling, a big red
balloon descended slowly from the roof. At the
bottom of this was a double trapeze, and as soon
as the balloon came within reach the Valbella
Brothers sprang up&mdash;we had to get rid of some
weights pretty cleverly to make the balloon rise,
because we couldn't manage the sand-bags commonly
used&mdash;grabbed at the trapeze, and performed
the double-trapeze act while the great illuminated
balloon rose slowly in the air up&mdash;up,
up, through the roof. Of course on the outside
two or three fellows stood on the roof, and we
threw them a rope with which they held on to the
balloon while we jumped off; and then the gas
was let out, and the balloon folded up and laid
away for the next day, because after the first night
we had to give two performances&mdash;one in the afternoon
and one in the evening&mdash;to satisfy the
people, and then the "standing-room only" sign
was out before the doors were opened.</p>

<p>Nothing like the applause on that first night
was ever known before. The people yelled and
stamped and shouted, and the ladies waved their
handkerchiefs. After a considerable time had
passed, Sam Stacker came to the foot-lights and
made a speech. Sam never lost a chance of making
a speech. He said the balloon couldn't rise
more than six miles in the air, and neither one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
the Valbella brothers could swim a stroke, and if
we were killed he intended to support our wives
and children during the rest of his natural life.
We didn't either of us have a wife and children,
but Sam didn't stick at a little thing like that.
"Anything to advertise," was Sam's motto. "I'd
let them durned newspapers say I choked my mother,
beat the ladies in the company every time I got
drunk, gambled on a coffin, and stole the cents off
a dead man's eyes, just to get the 'ad.'" As Sam
was the kindest, gentlest, softest-hearted old ruffian
that ever lived, there was, unfortunately, no chance
of any of this sort of thing being printed about
him, and this grieved him sincerely. Meanwhile
Ted and I were drinking ginger-pop behind the
scenes, and hearing every word Sam was saying.
Then Sam made his bow, and retired to find our
mangled remains, according to his alleged anticipations;
and finding us whole and sound, punishing
the ginger beer, he led us before the curtain,
and we received what the newspapers the next day
called "a magnificent ovation." And old Sam
Stacker almost cried with pleasure when he counted
up the box receipts and took us up to his hotel and
gave us champagne as if it was Apollinaris water.</p>

<p>I haven't said anything all this time about Jenny
Hobbs, but she was a person of great importance
to me just then. She was a dancer&mdash;we had
quite a respectable ballet troupe with us that year.
She wasn't the <i>première danseuse</i>, but she stood in
the front row, and figured in the bills as Mlle.
Celestine Buzac de la Montigny. Sam Stacker<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
himself invented that name. He said it sounded
fine. It certainly did. She had come to him one
morning just before we started on the road and
had asked for work. She was a modest little
thing, like a plenty of other ballet girls I know;
and I found out afterward she supported her bedridden
sister and took care of her little brother out
of her small wages. Sam was in a hurry, and told
her I was his representative&mdash;a great way he had
when he didn't want to be troubled with people;
so I put Miss Jenny Hobbs through her paces, and
saw she was a pretty good little dancer. We had
as the <i>première danseuse</i> Mlle. Dagmar&mdash;I don't
know what her name in private life was. She was
a fine dancer, but a stupid creature, without any
invention, and couldn't do anything she hadn't
been taught; and in a company like ours, we wanted
somebody who was equal to emergencies, which
Dag&mdash;we called her that for short&mdash;wasn't. Jenny
Hobbs was just that. She turned out a trump.
Of course we couldn't bring her forward over
Dag's nose, nor have her name very prominently
billed; but she didn't seem to mind that, so long
as she got an increase of wages, and something
for her little brother to do along with the company;
and she was worth all she got, and more
too. She never put herself forward, but when
Dagmar was ill, which at first was about twice a
week regularly, she took her place, and did almost
as well&mdash;so well in fact that it acted on Dag as the
advertisements say Hop Bitters acts&mdash;it cured her
right off of several chronic complaints of long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
standing, and from being ill half her time (though
nobody would have suspected it from her robust
appearance) she got able to dance six nights and
two afternoons in the week the whole season, and
never gave Jenny Hobbs another chance to take
her place. Then Jenny used to suggest little alterations
and improvements in the performance
that Dagmar listened to readily enough, as it always
brought her bouquets and applause, and Jenny
actually made her think that Dagmar originated
them herself.</p>

<p>Well, the night of our first ascent&mdash;it wasn't
more than thirty-five feet&mdash;after the fellows who
managed the balloon had got it anchored to the
roof, and we had climbed down and had got back
in the theatre and made our appearance before the
foot-lights, and the curtain had been rung up and
down half a dozen times, and at last the audience
had dispersed, somebody inquired for Jenny&mdash;for,
of course, nobody in the company ever thought of
calling her by that ridiculous name Sam had given
her. Just then her brother, little Jack Hobbs,
tore upon the stage, yelling for somebody to go to
Jenny. Of course there was a rush for her dressing-room,
headed by Sam Stacker and Dag, with
Ted and me following close behind. There lay
Jenny on the floor in her tights and spangles, her
head resting uncomfortably on a chair, and apparently
in a dead faint. Nobody knew how long
she had been there, as Jack, who always came to
take his sister home after the performance, couldn't
explain anything for sobbing and crying, except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
that after the balloon went up, and Sam Stacker
came before the curtain and told that astounding
lie about the balloon being six miles in the air, and
made his magnificent offer to take care of our wives
and children that didn't exist, Jenny had tumbled
over, screaming, "Oh, Ted," or "Oh, Ned," Jack
couldn't remember which. He hadn't been able to
bring her to since. Sam slapped her hands, Dag
loosened her dress, and I produced a brandy flask,
which Ted was about to take out of my hand and
put to her lips, but I preferred doing that myself,
and quietly pushed him away while I supported
her head and got a few drops of brandy between
her teeth. In a few minutes of this vigorous treatment
she recovered, did like all people coming out
of a fainting fit&mdash;sat up, wondered where she was,
had it all come back to her in a moment, and seizing
Jack, began to cry hysterically. Jack yelled
too, so we had a devil of a commotion for a while;
but Sam, who had sublime common sense, put an
end to it by calling a carriage, packing Dag and
Jack and Jenny in it, and sending them off to Jenny's
lodgings. Then we went to Sam's hotel and
got the champagne before mentioned.</p>

<p>But somehow, although Sam and the other fellows&mdash;we
got together a lot of them&mdash;toasted us
as the Valbella Brothers, and commended forever
our fraternal alliance, we didn't feel like brothers.
We had been the best of friends, but that little
blubbering rascal Jack Hobbs had planted something
in our hearts that grew like Jonah's gourd.
Which was it, Ted or Ned, that Jenny Hobbs had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
fainted about when we went through the roof hanging
on to each other by our teeth, our legs, and
everything except our hands, and doing the double-trapeze
act like daisies? There was the trouble.
Was it Ted or was it Ned? I had had a soft place
for Jenny in my heart for a considerable time, but I
had determined to wait until I found out whether
I had any chance or not, and then Ted&mdash;Valbella
I'll him for want of something better&mdash;had come
along, and seemed to like her too. But I had not
paid much attention to it until that night. Ted
was good-looking&mdash;I almost groaned when I saw
how good-looking he was&mdash;and a sober, honest, industrious
fellow to boot.</p>

<p>Somehow Sam and the other fellows seemed to
realize that we weren't quite so brotherly as we
had been, and consequently they enlarged upon
our fraternal feelings, and represented us as being
much more deeply attached to each other than we
ever could have been; but at last it was all over,
and we started to walk home&mdash;we had lodgings together.
As we came out into the quiet moonlit
streets I noticed Ted seemed to expect me to
speak.</p>

<p>"Now see here," said I, turning to him; "you
know what that little rascal said to-night?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," said Ted doggedly; "and I
know what Jenny Hobbs said too."</p>

<p>"It's more than anybody else does," said I,
feeling as if I wanted to choke him. "We'd better
not discuss that now," said I, presently; "we've
both had some champagne, and I want to think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
things over, and so do you, perhaps; so we'll let it
rest until to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Just as you like," said Ted sulkily.</p>

<p>We went home and went to bed, both rather
worn out with excitement. Next morning, just as
we were dressed and going to get some breakfast,
Sam Stacker came in, boiling. I don't know who
could have told him, or whether he guessed at it
from the way we looked the night before, but he
evidently knew that something was up between us.
So he sat right down and gave us a talking to.
"Now, boys," says he, very earnestly, "you see
how it is. You've made a tremendous hit with
that there balloon feature. Last night when I came
out and told that there whopper about the balloon
bein' six miles in the air, and broached that benevolent
scheme about your families, you ought to
have heard the women scream; it done my heart
good to hear 'em; two of 'em had to be carried
out in convulsions, and it would be worth five
thousand dollars' advertising if one of 'em was to
die. Of course if you fellows quarrel, we'll have
to drop the Valbella Brothers altogether, and
that'll make a difference in your salaries. Besides,
if you both get to making love to Jenny Hobbs, it
will upset the whole business, and I'll just have to
pay her the penalty in her contract, and get somebody
else in her place. That'll be hard on her,
poor girl, as she'll lose the best chance she's had
yet of getting introduced to the public. I really
had hoped you two fellows would have kept out of
difficulties with each other," continued Sam, groan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>ing.
"I swear there's but one thing worse than
quarreling in a theatrical company, and that is love-making.
Blamed if I don't post a fine for any man
in the company that's caught looking at a woman.
Love, anyhow, is the durndest, foolishest business
on top of the earth&mdash;no money in it and lots of
trouble&mdash;and here you are two fellows actually
risking a cut of twenty dollars a week for the sake
of a petticoat! It's wicked, I say, and blasphemous,
and it'll ruin the show business. And here
you've gone and brought the whole infernal bother
on my head, and I've been a good friend to you
both; and&mdash;and it's a shame&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sam stopped, almost crying. Neither one of
us fully believed his threat about parting with
Jenny, but it would clearly lead to trouble and
loss of money on all sides if the Valbella Brothers
came to grief. So it was tacitly understood that
for the remainder of the season neither one of us
should say a word to Jenny, and should go on as
usual; and afterward each would try his luck with
the pretty little dancer. Sam Stacker had intimated
privately to me that if we left off our trapeze
performance he and the rest of the company would
construe it that I was afraid to risk it with Ted,
considering the feeling between us, and I think he
also managed to convey the same idea to Ted, and
it had its effect on each. Sam swore that he intended
to advise Jenny to marry the trombone, who
had three wives in various stages of divorce, seven
small children, and who alternated between the
show business and that of a professional revivalist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>After that we went along as usual, and except
that we were more than commonly polite to each
other, nobody would have suspected anything was
the matter. While we had been friends we often
had little tiffs; but after we became enemies&mdash;for
that was what we inevitably became&mdash;we were politer
than French dancing masters to each other.
We didn't do the balloon-trapeze act everywhere.
If we only made one-night stands, or if the stage
was too small, or if the lessee of the house objected
to it, we didn't have it, but still we had five or
six weeks of it before Christmas, and Jenny never
would witness it, but went and hid her face when
it came off&mdash;so that only made it plainer that she
liked one of us, but which one nobody could guess.
It often occurred to me when we were rising slowly
on that trapeze in front of the foot-lights, doing
all kinds of monkey tricks while the people
yelled and shouted, and the balloon was going
up into the flies, that Ted could do me a mischief
that nobody would know anything about after I
was mashed and bruised out of shape by the fall,
and I dare say he thought the same of me. Nothing
happened, however, until one night&mdash;it was the
very night before Christmas. Now, excepting the
bad blood between the Valbella Brothers, I don't
believe there was a man or a woman in that company
who wasn't at peace and in good-will with
the others that blessed Christmas Eve. Sam Stacker
was such a kind, honest, soft-hearted but hard-headed
old customer that he made quarreling unpopular
and almost impossible. He had given us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
all something that day, and Jenny Hobbs's present
was the best of any. I wanted to give Jenny
something too, but I hardly thought it fair to my
understanding with Ted. But just before the performance
began, Jenny came to me, smiling and
blushing very much, and said:</p>

<p>"I've&mdash;I've got a Christmas gift for you."</p>

<p>"Have you?" cried I, delighted.</p>

<p>"You've been so k&mdash;k&mdash;kind to me," she stammered,
"getting Mr. Stacker to give me an engagement,
and taking Jack along too, and&mdash;and&mdash;all&mdash;that.
I want you to wear this in memory of a
friend." And she held out to me a little ring with
a coral set in it, and inside, sure enough, was, "In
memory of a friend." Of course I was delighted,
and I must say I tried to kiss her, but she slapped
my face, and I went back where Dag and a lot of
fellows were and showed my Christmas gift, and
they all laughed and wanted to know when it was
coming off. I dare say now it wasn't very generous
to show it and boast of it but the temptation
was irresistible, and, besides, it was no breach of
our engagement. I had made no advances to Jenny,
and perhaps, as I thought a little dispiritedly,
the mere friendliness of my behavior may have
been the reason she gave me the ring. But you
may be sure I kept that impression to myself, and
was willing to let the rest of the people think the
whole thing was settled.</p>

<p>Ted had seen it all, and I knew he was a determined
fellow, with a devilish temper when he was
roused, and he had enough to rouse him that night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
When we came on the stage together for our clog
dancing he was apparently as cool and smiling as
ever, but I saw danger in his eye. Mine didn't
quail, I don't think; and as we stood side by side,
our arms and shoulders touching, while the clogs
clattered and we sang our best songs full of good
hits, I knew that the final struggle was coming that
night, and I knew, too, that it would be on the
trapeze. Naturally I took fire too, and cared no
more for breaking up the Valbella Brothers and
interfering with Sam Stacker's plans, nor, indeed,
for anything except that Ted should not get the
better of me. The jealous devil possessed us both.
The performance went off first-rate. The Dagmar
was ill again for a wonder&mdash;this time a real <i>bona
fide</i> illness&mdash;and Jenny had to take her place. She
came out all in clouds of tulle, and danced a <i>ballet
divertissement</i> called "La Marguerite," in which she
pulled a daisy to pieces to see if she was loved.
She danced it beautifully, and fairly brought the
house down, and when she got through she had
half a dozen bouquets of flowers, and a great big
trapeze made of flowers was tilted over the heads
of the orchestra to her. I had had nothing to do
with it, but she thought I had, and turned to me
as I stood in the wings and courtesied so prettily
that it fairly maddened Ted, who saw it all, and
thought, too, I had sent it to her, and thereby
broken our agreement. I didn't choose to explain
then and there how it was, and the next minute it
was our turn to go on the stage.</p>

<p>We got through our part pretty well. Ted was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
cool, and so was I. The people applauded tremendously,
and when the red balloon came slowly
sailing down they almost went wild. As usual,
when it came just above our heads, we jumped up,
caught the trapeze, got rid of the weights by
sleight-of-hand, and went up through the roof,
vaulting and tumbling over each other.</p>

<p>In a minute or two we were through the big
hole in the top. It was then the time for one of
us to throw the rope to the fellows who stood
about on the roof to catch it, and to haul the balloon
back. But instead of throwing the rope&mdash;it
was Ted's turn to throw it that night&mdash;he seized
it, and gathered it up out of reach of the fellows
on the roof grabbing for it, and&mdash;the balloon went
flying up into the black sky!</p>

<p>It was a murky night, but the moon shone fitfully
at intervals. As we shot up from the roof I
heard a wild cry, and then another, louder and
wilder, from the people in the street, who saw us
darting upward to a hideous death. For my own
part, I don't remember anything for a while, but I
clung instinctively to the trapeze and braced myself
against the horizontal bars. I could feel that
we were rushing through currents of air, but the
balloon was steady, and as soon as I recovered my
senses at all I looked steadily upward. We were
going through clouds, and I could feel that Ted
was crawling toward me on the trapeze.</p>

<p>At last he got quite close to me. His white,
desperate face was fearful in the ghastly uncertain
glare. The moon shone out, and I saw that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
small rope connecting with the safety-valve was
fastened around his wrist. He held it up to me.</p>

<p>"You understand what this means?" he said.
"If I go over, the valve comes open."</p>

<p>I understood well enough.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "we can settle about Jenny
Hobbs."</p>

<p>It was cold, and my teeth were chattering, but
I managed to say: "It's all settled, it strikes me.
We are both dead men."</p>

<p>"Not I," said he. "I have been studying up
balloons on the sly. I know all about this one. I
can manage her. Now tell me, will you give up
Jenny Hobbs? If you don't&mdash;" He pointed to
the clouds scurrying beneath us.</p>

<p>"You are a sneak and a coward," I said.
"We've both got to die this Christmas Eve, but
you'll meet your Maker a murderer and a suicide."</p>

<p>The balloon, it seemed to me, was stationary
then. He crept closer and closer to me. I could
see the whites of his eyes. I thought my time had
come. I could not remember any words of prayer,
but my soul uttered its inarticulate cry for mercy,
which God can hear.</p>

<p>Suddenly the balloon gave a furious lurch, and
before my very eyes I saw him jerked violently
backward. I have no clear recollection of what
happened next. I suppose, with an acrobat's instinct,
he clutched the bar. But I felt the balloon
descending with a horrible rush that no human
being could describe. Then it slacked up, and I
saw Ted clinging with both hands to the trapeze,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
but his legs were dangling frightfully in the air.
The rope was still tied to his wrist, and the spring
of the valve had closed.</p>

<p>It is easy enough for any active young fellow
to climb on a bar if he has a good purchase with
his hands; but the best acrobat in the world, suspended
he knows not how far from the earth, in
mortal danger and mortal terror, can't do it. I
saw that Ted couldn't. I saw his terrified and distorted
face turned up to mine. I won't describe
what I felt in that moment. But in the half darkness
I felt the rope that the balloon had been held
by slap against my face. I reached up and caught
it. Then I crawled along the bar to Ted. I wanted
to save him; but I also knew, if he let go, the
valve would come open, and we would both be
dashed into limitless space. He saw me coming
toward him. I suppose he thought I meant to
push him off, for he uttered the first loud sound
I had heard in that awful stillness&mdash;a piercing
scream of anguish. I saw him clutch the bar with
a wild determination that gave me courage to proceed.
I made the rope into a big loop, and threw
it around his body. It caught the first time, and I
drew it up under his arms. Then he seemed to
realize that I was trying to save him. I took the
ends of the rope, and, holding on firmly to the bar,
wrapped the ends securely around it, and tied
them, hard and tight. Then I reached over and
grasped the valve rope, and began to pull it
gently.</p>

<p>I suppose the gas in the balloon had been con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>siderably
exhausted before, for as soon as I
touched the valve we began to go down frightfully
fast. I closed it up for a few moments, and
noticed we were descending slowly. I opened the
valve again the least in the world, and we began
to go down pretty fast&mdash;not so alarmingly fast;
but it had flashed through me that perhaps if we
went too slowly in the beginning the gas would be
exhausted before we reached the bottom and we
would be dashed to pieces, and I didn't understand
enough about balloons to know that the same
quantity of gas would carry us the same distance
fast or slow. Presently I saw a line of light which
I took to be the river, then the masts of shipping
in the harbor, then the church steeples, the houses,
the street lamps. Oh, God! I heard the cries of
human voices&mdash;so close, so close! and when we
were only a few feet from the ground I got dizzy
and fell&mdash;far, far into space&mdash;and went to sleep
before I reached the bottom.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The next morning was Christmas morning.
Ah, what a day! May be people think that professional
acrobats haven't any religious instincts;
but I know I went to church that day, and found
Jenny there, and afterward we took a walk out
into the country. It was a very happy walk, and
it was God's day, and she had screamed "Oh,
Ned!" after all, the night that Jack made the row.
This gave me much solid satisfaction.</p>

<p>Before I got out of my bed that morning (I
had had a regular fainting spell, and had tum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>bled
off the trapeze about ten feet from the
ground, but had been caught) I opened my eyes
and saw Ted standing over me. He looked like
a ghost.</p>

<p>"Ned," said he, "I can't talk about it. I can
hardly think or feel yet; but you understand," he
gasped out.</p>

<p>I thought I did understand, so I held out my
hand. His hand felt like a lump of ice. Sam
Stacker was a sight to see. He had the hang of
the whole thing. Its value as an advertisement
made him perfectly dizzy with delight, but he was
wild with misery at the same time, because he
hadn't the cheek&mdash;and Sam was a cheeky fellow
too&mdash;to propose that the Valbella Brothers should
continue their performances; and between admiration
and chagrin he was almost crazy. All that
day he was like a wild man, and finally, considering
the Valbella Brothers would discontinue their
performances immediately, as our reconciliation
didn't go the length of acting together again, we
concluded to appear before the curtain at the close
of the Christmas performance that night, just to
please Sam.</p>

<p>As soon as Sam found it out he got out the
biggest posters to be had for love or money, saying
we would appear on the stage that night, although
we were both too disabled by the severe
shock we had received to take any further part in
the performances. We went, and when the curtain
rose at the end of the last act, and we were bowing,
one on each side of Sam, you never heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
such a perfectly terrible commotion in your life;
and the next instant a party of gentlemen rustled
out of a box, headed by the mayor of the town,
and, advancing to the stage, made a long address.
I didn't take in what it was about, but at last it
dawned upon my feeble intelligence that the
mayor was commending my bravery for rescuing
my comrade by tying him to the trapeze, and presenting
me with a magnificent gold watch and
chain. Of course I couldn't say a word, but Sam
Stacker returned thanks for me. He said it was
the greatest occasion of his life, and I believe it
was. He spoke three quarters of an hour, in a
voice like a steam calliope, and waving his arms
up and down like a Dutch windmill. It makes my
head swim now to think about that speech. After
it was all over I took Sam aside.</p>

<p>"Sam," says I, "don't you know if I hadn't
tied Ted to the trapeze he'd have fallen and
dragged the valve open, and we'd both have been
killed?"</p>

<p>"D'ye think I'm a durned fool?" said Sam
quite fiercely. "Certainly I know it, but I ain't
a-going to tell them blooming idiots and lunk-heads
yonder that don't know beans from thunder."</p>

<p>These were the gentlemen whom Sam had just
been apostrophizing as the noblest examples of
human virtue and intelligence he had ever yet
come across during a long experience with the
greatest show on earth.</p>

<p>Well, there isn't much more to tell. The Val<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>bella
Brothers partnership was dissolved, but I
stayed on with Sam, and am at present part proprietor
of the show.</p>

<p>I forgot to say that Jenny and I were married
just before the performance that Christmas night.</p>

<h2 id="THEODORA">THEODORA.</h2></div>


<p>One morning in April, 1889, all that part of the
population around Prince's Gate that was up and
stirring at seven o'clock, gaped with surprise and
said to each other, "The McGuckin houses are let."
The footmen loitering in the gorgeous vestibules,
the housemaids lazily straightening their caps as
they threw wide the silken curtains, the milkmen
clattering upon their rounds, all regarded with interest
the great granite pile that had stood tenantless
since the day the builders and decorators left
it ten years before. For the McGuckin houses
were so vast and splendid that living in them would
have been dear had the rent been thrown in.
Luckily, there were but two of them. The lack of
tenants had driven the original McGuckin to suicide&mdash;but&mdash;it
never rains but it pours. The tenants that
had been ten years in coming both arrived the
same week. One house was taken by Sir John
Blood, of Blood Hall, Suffolk, nephew and heir of
the Marquis of Longacre, and the other by an
American family named March.</p>

<p>Although Sir John's wealth and position may
be inferred from the meager particulars already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
given of him, yet must the Marches be described
first. And Theodora March must not only take
precedence of the nephew and heir of the Marquis
of Longacre, but of her own family as well&mdash;for
to Theodora had this precedence always been allowed,
although the very youngest scion of the
house of March. She was slender and supple, and
had a beautiful head of rich gold hair that made
an aureole around her pure and sparkling face.
By one of those freaks, so common in American
civilization, Theodora, whose ancestors had for
unnumbered generations sold hardware and cutlery
and groceries, and were born and bred to
trade and barter, looked as if she had all of the
blood of all of the Howards in her veins. March
<i>père</i>, like Napoleon, might have been called the
first of his family, but Theodora had grown up
with all the tendencies toward a privileged class
floating around in American society. She stamped
her letters with a crest she could almost persuade
herself her ancestors had borne at the battle of
Agincourt, and adopted the Earls de la Marche of
the middle ages as her progenitors. Like many
others who may be called fugitives from the lower
middle class, she hated it with indescribable intensity,
and shook her small white fist at it and stoned
it whenever she got a chance.</p>

<p>Besides Theodora there was Anne, a pretty
but incomplete model of Nature's gorgeous after-thought,
the younger sister. Theodora was a
leonine blonde, while Anne was a nondescript.
Mrs. March, an amiable, obstinate old person, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the third and last and least interesting of the
family.</p>

<p>The Marches had endured for years the nomadic
existence preferred by many rich Americans.
Like the Bedouins of the desert, they had
moved their belongings from place to place at a
moment's notice. But an acquaintance at Homburg
with the Honorable Mrs. Wodehouse had inspired
in Theodora a yearning for a London season&mdash;and
Theodora, being the master spirit and
motor for the March family, promptly transported
them all to London, and the first week in April
found them settled in one of the two finest mansions
at Prince's Gate. Meanwhile a great event
had happened in Anne's life. One William McBean,
a lieutenant in a Highland regiment, with one
thousand pounds to his fortune besides his pay,
had met Anne on the Continent, and, after falling
hopelessly in love and communicating the same
malady to her, was just about exchanging into a
regiment going to India because he had not the
courage to ask the rich American girl to marry
him. Theodora, who had a good heart, and was
grieved to see Anne pale and <i>distrait</i>, and poor
William McBean looking like a ghost, homely and
red-headed at that, took matters into her own
hands. She made a vigorous sortie on William
McBean, wormed his secret out of him, laughed at
his scruples, proposed for him, accepted for Anne,
and had the satisfaction of seeing two worthy people
perfectly happy, and all her own doing too.
Mrs. Wodehouse laughed at the match; but Theo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>dora
extended her protecting arm over the lovers,
and, slender and white as that arm was, it was a
mighty ægis.</p>

<p>It can not be supposed that the Marches remained
long in ignorance of the name and quality
of their next neighbor at Prince's Gate. Within a
fortnight Theodora had seen Sir John on his balcony
smoking, had heard the click of his billiard
balls through the open window, while Sir John
had listened with pleasure to her clear trilling as
she took her singing lesson. Anne did nothing
now but sit on a bench in Kensington Palace Gardens
and gaze in rapture on William McBean's
honest, ugly face&mdash;a gaze which the red-headed
lieutenant returned with compound interest. The
sight of their innocent happiness amused and
pleased Theodora excessively. It was love's
young dream with a vengeance.</p>

<p>One morning Mrs. Wodehouse arrived at the
Marches' house in a great flutter. She had got
cards for them to a grand ball to be given at the
house of a K. G., K. C. B., S. E. I., and what not,
and the cards bore the talisman "To meet H. R.
H.&mdash;" It was the finest of the very great balls
of the season, and Mrs. Wodehouse was in high
feather at the notion of introducing her young
friends on such an occasion, for Mrs. March had
thankfully rendered up to her the office of chaperon.
The question of a presentation at court was
wisely deferred until another season.</p>

<p>"And it's not improbable, dear," said Mrs.
Wodehouse, surveying with admiration Theodora's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
fresh beauty and captivating air, "that you may
go as Miladi with&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A great big lozenge on my carriage," laughed
Theodora. "I used to think," she added more
gravely, "that Englishmen were pachyderms, but
upon my word they are the spooniest set&mdash;Anne,
what are you blushing for?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking of&mdash;of&mdash;," answered Anne,
turning a yet more fiery red.</p>

<p>"Of William McBean," said Theodora, with
cruel mirth, "you know you were. You're always
thinking of William McBean."</p>

<p>"My dear girl," remarked Mrs. Wodehouse
plaintively to Anne, "with your opportunities and
nice looks, and money&mdash;you might look higher
than a lieutenant in a marching regiment. It's a
sacrifice, dear&mdash;a sacrifice which I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Wodehouse," cried Anne, rising and
looking at Mrs. Wodehouse quite savagely, "I insist
that you shall not mention this matter again.
I'm&mdash;I'm not called upon to justify myself to you&mdash;but
I think when a girl marries a man and a
gentleman&mdash;even if he is poor&mdash;she does herself
honor, and although we've got money ourselves, I
feel the greatest respect for a poor gentleman&mdash;and
if he is so disinterested that he almost forces
her to make the offer herself, it's no sacrifice&mdash;"</p>

<p>If a meek and much enduring sheep had turned
on a hungry wolf, Mrs. Wodehouse could not have
been more surprised than at Anne's spirit. But
Theodora, who rarely permitted Anne to finish a
sentence, here broke in:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
"No, it <i>isn't</i> a sacrifice&mdash;even if he <i>has</i> a red
head and lisps dreadfully. Fortunately, I don't
want to marry William McBean myself. I want&mdash;I
don't know what I want. Not money&mdash;I have
plenty of that."</p>

<p>"I think," continued Anne quite boldly, "that
American girls are seldom mercenary. We have
our faults, but that's not one of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Theodora, with an air of great
magnanimity, marching up and down the room,
"we have our faults, but at least we are not mercenary,
or designing, or mean, or anything of that
sort. Nor are we headstrong like English girls
are sometimes&mdash;or ungenerous toward each other,
or given to gossip. We make ourselves agreeable
abroad, but that does not prevent our making our
homes little paradises for those we love&mdash;and we
are not a bit conceited."</p>

<p>Anne attempted a mild suggestion that Theo
hadn't left any faults at all with which American
girls could be justly charged, but it was ruthlessly
swept away in a hurricane of merry talk and
laughter from Theodora about the ball, her gown,
and all the cheerful, costly things that made up
the life of Josiah C. March's lucky daughter. Mrs.
Wodehouse left, arranging to come to their house
on the evening of the ball, whence they would
all go in the March's carriage and she would remain
the rest of the night at Prince's Gate.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The night of the ball finally arrived. By one
of those occult processes so difficult for the mas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>culine
intelligence to comprehend, Theodora and
Anne and Mrs. March found out that Sir John
Blood was going to the ball too. Many speculations
as to whether he would ask to be introduced
or not went through the head of this young daughter
of the great republic, but she said never a
word. Anne and her mother though prattled incessantly
about Sir John and the ball, to all of
which Theodora listened with the air of lofty indifference
which an American girl assumes where
men are concerned, and apparently cared no more
about Sir John Blood than she did about the future
King of Bulgaria. The March carriage containing
Mrs. Wodehouse drove up to Prince's Gate
about ten o'clock on a bright May evening. At
the same instant Sir John Blood's brougham was
whirled to his door. Mrs. March stood in the
doorway to enjoy the sight of her nestlings getting
into the carriage. Mrs. Wodehouse did not descend.
Anne came first, tripping down the carpeted
steps, looking uncommonly pretty in a blue
gown.</p>

<p>"How charming you are, dear!" cried Mrs.
Wodehouse.</p>

<p>"Just wait till you see Theo," answered Anne
a little discontentedly. It is hard to be always
and invariably outshone even when one has an
angel named McBean to soothe one's self-love.</p>

<p>At that moment Sir John Blood appeared at
his own door. He might well have got into his
brougham and gone, but he delayed a moment or
two&mdash;and in that moment Theodora sailed down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the steps. A cloud of silver <i>crêpe</i> enveloped her
and floated far behind her. Her slender form was
molded into a bodice so simple and yet so exquisite
that it was a poem in satin. Around the
white pillar of her matchless throat she wore a
string of pearls, and pearls hung upon the front of
her corsage and skirt until both seemed sowed
with gems. Mrs. Wodehouse threw up her hands in
silent ecstasy. The coachman turned and gaped
with delight, and so did the footman who shut the
carriage door after her.</p>

<p>Not only did Sir John Blood as well as his
servants gaze in admiration, but a group of
ragged urchins began to "hooray," as the carriage
rolled off. Theodora leaned back in her
corner of the carriage, enjoying her little triumph
as only a young and beautiful woman can. Nor
did the triumph end there. When they ascended
the grand staircase and entered the ball-room, a
kind of admiring murmur followed Theodora.
The whole evening was a repetition of these trivial
but delicious successes that are dear to every
woman's heart.</p>

<p>The very first person on whom Theodora's
eyes rested was Sir John Blood, and half an hour
had scarcely passed before he came up and asked
for an introduction. Theodora was surprised to
see Mrs. Wodehouse receive Sir John with something
like haughtiness. She barely consented to
introduce him, and seized the first opportunity to
whisper in Theodora's ear agonizingly&mdash;"He's a
widower&mdash;don't for Heaven's sake&mdash;dear girl&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Theodora thought Mrs. Wodehouse had gone
suddenly crazy, but she retained her self-possession
and gracefully returned Sir John's bow, which was
a kind of salaam or kowtow.</p>

<p>"I have the honor," he said, "of living next to
Miss March."</p>

<p>Theodora smiled her own dazzling smile at
this. "Yes," she replied, "and I want you to
credit me with great virtue in shutting tight all
the double windows when I am taking my singing
lessons so that I shall not make myself odious to
my neighbors."</p>

<p>"Do you call that kind?" said Sir John.
"Shall we take a turn and talk about it?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Wodehouse actually put out her hand to
detain Theodora, but Theo was already beyond her
grasp.</p>

<p>She stole a side glance at her companion as
they moved off, that gave her a much better idea
of him than she had before. He was very tall
and certainly distinguished looking, but there was
something, an intense blackness around the eye,
and a bluish tinge about the full black beard that
gave him a sinister look. As they passed through
the throng of splendid women and thorough-bred
looking men, a very old man, much braced and
padded, who stood up stiffly as if he feared he
could not get up again if he sat down, and whose
breast was covered by a broad blue ribbon,
touched Sir John on the arm and mumbled something
in his ear. Sir John, smiling, said to Theodora:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is the Marquis of Longacre. He wants
to be presented to you. He is nearly ninety, but
his eye for beauty is as keen as it was fifty years
ago."</p>

<p>Theodora colored brilliantly. A marquis asking
to be presented to Josiah C. March's daughter
was a big thing, as the defunct March would have
expressed it&mdash;and although Sir John had not said
a word about his relationship to the old gentleman,
yet Theodora knew all about it, having
studied the subject thoroughly in Debrett. So,
after taking a turn about the ball-room, they returned.
Sir John presented the marquis, and then
courteously stepped aside that the old gentleman
might have her all to himself.</p>

<p>This was the marquis's first observation:
"Good Gad! are all the girls in America as pretty
as you are?"</p>

<p>"Most of them are a great deal prettier,"
laughed Theodora, with the ready adaptability of
her compatriots.</p>

<p>"It must be a doosid jolly place, then,"
chuckled the marquis.</p>

<p>"Why don't you come over and take a look at
us?" archly remarked the sprightly Theo, purposely
oblivious of the marquis's eighty-five years.</p>

<p>"Because I'm eighty-five. Eighty-five's a bore,
my dear young lady. You don't believe me, eh?
Women never believe a man unless he lies to 'em,"
remarked the marquis with a wheeze which was
meant for a sigh. "I often tell my nephew John&mdash;the
one you're walking with&mdash;he won't have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
wait long to be Marquis of Longacre. It's a
pity that none of his wives could live to enjoy
it."</p>

<p>"His wives!" cried Theodora, surprised into
an exclamation. The marquis seemed disposed to
confidence.</p>

<p>"Yes, he's had three. All died like sheep.
Something ailed 'em, I dare say. I'm advising him
to get another, and 'pon my soul, Americans seem
to be the fashion, he, he!"</p>

<p>A sudden shock not far from disgust thrilled
Theodora. Three wives already&mdash;and he not a
day over forty-five, apparently. As in a dream
she heard the marquis's tremulous old voice saying
something she only half understood. But in a
moment or two she pulled herself together. After
all it was an illiberal prejudice. Should a man's
domestic misfortune be made a subject of reproach
to him?</p>

<p>In a moment Sir John came to fetch her and
carried her back to Mrs. Wodehouse. Then that
lady began the same inexplicably aggressive tactics
toward him again. But it was in vain. He
was not to be frozen out or bullied, and if ever a
man was winged at the first shot, it was Sir John
Blood. He hovered near Theodora, asked permission
to call, and showed in every way a passionate
admiration for her.</p>

<p>But Sir John was not the only one who bit the
dust, so to speak, in consequence of Theodora's
charms. She levied on the Church as well as the
state. An archbishop, although attended by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
body guard of four hawk-eyed single daughters,
suddenly found himself deep in a roaring flirtation
with this new star of the West, and it can not be
said that his Grace did not hold up his end of the
line valiantly. The four single daughters stood
like a Roman phalanx against all widows, whom
they considered their natural enemies, but it never
occurred to them to be on their guard against
anything as young and apparently as artless as
Theodora&mdash;they being unfamiliar with the type of
the wily American maiden, who, under an exterior
as harmless as a dove, conceals the wisdom of the
serpent. In addition to the archbishop, a general
officer, who had gone through eighteen London
seasons without a scratch, was slain at Theodora's
first fire, and as for the lieutenants, the slaughter
was fearful. It was a Waterloo, and Theodora was
a she-Wellington.</p>

<p>At last the ball was over. Theodora and her
party were rolling homeward. A certain constraint
existed among them, and Sir John Blood's name
was not once mentioned. When they reached home
all the ladies scurried into a cozy morning room,
where a sleepy footman gave them tea. A little
fire crackled on the hearth, and what will not a
wood fire do toward unlocking the secret confidences
of the female breast? Therefore, as Mrs.
Wodehouse saw Theodora's tiny satin slippered feet
seek hers in friendly juxtaposition on the fender, a
sudden determination seized her to make a clean
breast of it all.</p>

<p>"Theodora," she said, "do you know anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
about Sir John Blood, who was so attentive to you
to-night?"</p>

<p>"Nothing in the world except that he is very
distinguished looking, very sensible, and lives in
the next house," answered Theodora, debonairly.</p>

<p>"And will be Marquis of Longacre when that
old stuffed penguin dies we saw to-night. I'd
rather have a poor lieutenant with a Tel-el-Kebir
medal&mdash;" began Anne, but as usual was promptly
cut short. This time it was Mrs. Wodehouse who
broke in, after putting down her cup in some agitation.</p>

<p>"Theodora, do you know Sir John's domestic
history?"</p>

<p>"I know he has had three wives," answered
Theo with much indifference, as if three wives were
the usual allowance.</p>

<p>"But d-d-do you know <i>how they died?</i>" cried
Mrs. Wodehouse, becoming every moment more
agitated; "and the terrible closet in Blood Hall?"
And beginning to wring her hands, she sobbed.</p>

<p>"Oh, Theo, Theo&mdash;I've introduced to you the
original Bl&mdash;I can't call the dreadful name. But
he's the original B-Bluebe&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this Anne turned deadly pale, and running
over to her sister threw her arms about Theodora's
neck.</p>

<p>"Oh, Theo, darling, don't&mdash;don't have anything
to do with that dreadful man! Did you notice the
color of his beard&mdash;it was perfectly <i>blue black! I</i>
understand, if Theo doesn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>Just then a scream resounded behind them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Mrs. March, in a costume very like the one in
which Zerlina in the opera dances before the looking-glass,
had entered unobserved, and had heard it
all and being a highly nervous and excitable person,
shrieked at the terrible insinuation which she
at once comprehended. Theodora jumped up and
gazed around imperiously.</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, don't behave so! I never
saw Sir John in my life until to-night, and here you
are going on as if I were to marry him to-morrow!"</p>

<p>"This is the way he always does," whimpered
Mrs. Wodehouse. "The poor misguided girls fall
in love with him and marry him&mdash;the last one at
Constantinople&mdash;her name was Fatima&mdash;something
or other."</p>

<p>"I dare say," said Theodora, with wide, bright
eyes and a voice full of scorn, "he never married
an American girl. He wouldn't find one of them
so easy to get rid of if he is what you intimate
he is."</p>

<p>"Theodora," sobbed Mrs. March, "I'll never,
never give my consent. I don't care if he is Marquis
of Longacre, or Duke of Longacre, or Prince
of Longacre, he shall never have my precious
child."</p>

<p>Theodora by this time was walking up and
down the room with her pretty brows bent. Presently
she came and stood in front of her mother.</p>

<p>"Mamma," said she, "it has just occurred to
me that perhaps it is my duty&mdash;<i>my duty</i>&mdash;to marry
this misguided man. Three women have already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
fallen victims to him&mdash;but not one was an American.
I believe, from the very depths of my soul,
that, if a really clever American girl should take
hold of him, she could make him a model husband.
Yes," cried Theodora, warming with her own eloquence,
and beginning again to march up and
down, "look at Sir Roger MacTurk. Wasn't he a
perfect terror until he got a wife from New York?&mdash;and
now I believe he would play the concertina
if Lady MacTurk told him to. And Lord Cantantram&mdash;everybody
knows how that soft-voiced little
thing from the South dragoons him. Oh, I can tell
you, when an Englishman marries an American he
doesn't have any bed of roses. Of course they
don't let on&mdash;that's their British pluck&mdash;and they
do fib in the most manly and splendid way about
it all&mdash;but I think an Englishman married to an
American girl, and who lives and dies a Christian,
ought to be painted with a nimbus around his
head. Yes, I do. Anne, don't glower at me in that
way. Now, an Englishman, for all he is so big and
brave, can't resist an American girl when she looks
at him this way." Here Theodora paused, quite
breathless, threw up her head, and assumed an air
that might well make a six-footer shake in his
shoes.</p>

<p>These observations seemed to nettle Mrs.
Wodehouse somewhat.</p>

<p>"I remember Colonel Cairngorm telling me&mdash;"
began she.</p>

<p>"Colonel Cairngorm!" cried Theodora, throwing
up her hands in a paroxysm of despair that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
would have made her fortune at the Comédie
Française.</p>

<p>"You needn't laugh at him," responded Mrs.
Wodehouse tartly; and then, with a slight blush,
she added: "It is not impossible that&mdash;in fact&mdash;to
be very confidential&mdash;he proposed last week; I've
got it under consideration&mdash;he is certainly a very
pleasant person."</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Theodora candidly, "he is a nice
man&mdash;but he does make the greatest gaby of himself
when he is in the act of proposing I ever saw
in my life, and I've heard half a dozen girls say
the same thing." The look in Theodora's eye said
as plainly as could be, "Aha! we are quits for
what you have said of Sir John Blood"; and for
Mrs. Wodehouse, the iron had entered her soul.</p>

<p>"And I think," continued Theodora, with an air
of profound philosophy, "that the art of proposing
is a gift with some men, and others, like Colonel
Cairngorm, can't acquire it even after much practice.
I recollect he made me perfectly ill on the
occasion."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wodehouse had always thought American
girls too nimble of wit, and was more than ever
convinced of it then.</p>

<p>"Theo," began Anne, timidly, "for a woman
who loves, there is a certain glorious kind of slavery,
says Wil&mdash;"</p>

<p>Theodora dashed at her sister and good-naturedly
boxed her ears and touzled her hair.</p>

<p>"Anne, if you wish to drive me wild, continue
to talk about that long-legged lieutenant. William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
McBean will be my death, I know he will. Come,
I'm going. Good-night, everybody. Go to bed,
Anne, and dream about the McBean person." And
she was off, the silver gauze of her train floating
after her like a comet's tail.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>All the next day gloom hung over the March
household. Nobody mentioned Sir John Blood's
name. Mrs. Wodehouse left early. It was well
she did, for at precisely five o'clock, when Theodora
with Mrs. March and Anne were sitting in
the drawing-room, the footman threw open the
door and announced:</p>

<p>"The Marquis of Longacre and Sir John Blood."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The object in bringing the tottering and doddering
old marquis along soon appeared. He at
once engaged in a senile and simultaneous flirtation
with Mrs. March and Anne, while Sir John
devoted himself to Theodora. Anne, too, was
finally drawn into conversation with the pair, and
so fascinating were Sir John's manners that she
quite forgot his character and experiences, and,
strangely <i>maladroit</i>, made some allusion to Henry
the Eighth, whom she declared to be a murderous
old tyrant.</p>

<p>"Why?" mildly asked Sir John, and taking up
the subject of Henry's killing his wives, he elucidated
it in so masterly a manner that to Anne's
amazement she found herself admitting that
Henry was a much maligned individual, and deserved
all the credit which he claimed before Par<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>liament
in being willing to assume the fetters of
matrimony a sixth time for the good of his beloved
subjects, after five successive disappointments.</p>

<p>But why prolong the tale? Theodora was full
of enthusiasm&mdash;Sir John was full of love&mdash;and
proposed within a fortnight. Anne wept, tormented
her lover with her apprehensions for Theodora,
Mrs. March implored, but Theodora, bright
and brave, would not be dissuaded.</p>

<p>"You'll see," she cried. "Fatima&mdash;don't talk
to me about Fatima&mdash;a great fat creature with no
spirit at all. I'll charm him if he'll let me. Don't
you suppose I believe in love as much as every
other woman does? But if he undertakes to cut
my throat&mdash;"</p>

<p>Shrieks from Mrs. March completed the sentence.
But it was of no use. Theodora's mind
was made up and with that young woman, her
word was law.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In July, Theodora March and Sir John Blood
were married at St. George's, Hanover Square.
The Archbishop of Canterbury performed the ceremony,
the American minister gave the bride away,
and the Prince of Wales signed the register. The
settlements were splendid. Sir John voluntarily
resigned all interest in Theodora's fortune in case
he survived her. This affair about the settlements
gave Theodora, a slight shock, as she turned it
over in her mind. For the first time she realized
what it was to marry a man with such a fatal facility
for getting rid of his wives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pshaw!" she said to herself, "no doubt the
story books have exaggerated very much. There
can't be a whole closet full. And he is such a delightful
person, just like the charming man Heine
met at the Spanish ambassador's, who turned out
to be the devil. However, I'm an American"&mdash;and
at this a mighty exultation filled her breast&mdash;"I
am from that glorious land of pink and white
tyranny. Sir John Blood can't frighten me with
any children's stories of a closet full of defunct
wives." And so she went on, to Anne's and her
mother's distress and William McBean's intense
amusement, who was willing to back Theodora
against Blue Beard and give long odds any day.</p>

<p>Immediately after the marriage they went
abroad, and after some months of travel they returned
to England. Theodora had made but one
request of her husband since her marriage. It was
that her sister Anne might meet her in London and
accompany her to Blood Hall. This Sir John
granted with the uniform tenderness he had shown
to her. It was a clear autumn evening when, after
a rapturous meeting at the station, the sisters had
traveled down to Suffolk, and for the first time
found themselves alone in the drawing-room, while
Sir John smoked his after-dinner cigar on the terrace.</p>

<p>"Theo," said Anne, placing her hands on her sister's
shoulders. "Tell me, darling, are you happy?"</p>

<p>"Happy!" echoed Theodora brightly. "I am
the happiest girl in the world, and Sir John is the
best and kindest of men."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>"Except Wil&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, I don't except anybody. To think you
and mamma should have disliked him so much.
Anne, he's so changed sometimes I doubt if he is
the real Bl&mdash; you know what. But if he is, he'll
find out what kindness and firmness together can
do&mdash;and American pluck and the habit of command."</p>

<p>"Dear, happy, sweet Theo!"</p>

<p>"And that horrid Mrs. Wodehouse&mdash;Anne, he
has told me all about his wives. They all died perfectly
natural deaths. When his last wife died he
wanted to throw himself in the grave."</p>

<p>"Theo, please don't talk that way&mdash;I wouldn't
say such a thing about William for&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And he says if I die he means to marry
another American girl."</p>

<p>"Oh, please, please, Theo," cried Anne in a distressed
voice.</p>

<p>Just then Sir John sauntered in, smiling and
bland, with a request for some music.</p>

<p>Although Theodora had told Anne the truth
about some things, she had not told her the whole
truth. She saw very plainly that Sir John kept
back more than he told about her predecessors.
But this story has been a total failure if its readers
do not yet know that Theodora possessed a superb
and matchless courage that might well make Sir
John tremble. Nor had Sir John been married to
this dauntless creature five months without seeing
that the was made of sterner stuff than poor Fatima
and the rest. Each had felt, in golden days by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
Como's lake and in starlit Venetian nights, that
sometime or other there would come a tussle for ascendency,
and by a sort of tacit arrangement it was
postponed until their arrival at Blood Hall. When
Theodora had asked for her sister Anne's company,
Sir John had taken it as a confession of weakness.
Theodora, on the contrary, when she had carried
her point, felt flushed with victory. Naturally she
kept a sharp lookout for the closet which Mrs.
Wodehouse had dwelt upon; and in forty-eight
hours after her arrival she had pitched upon it. It
opened into a pleasant room which Sir John called
his study, and where he usually spent his mornings.
The door was of black Spanish oak, beautifully
carved in early English designs. Theodora had
mapped out a campaign in which that closet figured,
and about two weeks after her arrival she
opened hostilities.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One stormy December night, Theodora, leaving
Anne cowering over the drawing-room fire, sauntered
off into Sir John's study, carrying her favorite
poodle in her arms.</p>

<p>"Come in," said he in response to her knock,
and rising with ready courtesy. "You'll excuse my
continuing my paper," he remarked, wheeling a
comfortable chair to the sparkling wood fire for
her.</p>

<p>"Indeed I will not!" cried Theodora playfully,
still holding on to the poodle, and taking the paper
out of his hands almost before he knew it.</p>

<p>Sir John frowned and then smiled. His Ameri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>can
wife had certain ways that baffled him. She was
always amiable, gay, and affectionate, but she took
a tone toward him which startled while it amused
him; and then her surprising glibness, her humor,
her propensity to make small, though admirable
jokes, her way of looking at life from the comic
side, was astonishing, not to say appalling. Sir
John wondered sometimes if American men were
subject to much of this sort of thing.</p>

<p>"No," kept on Theodora, with a pretty grimace,
and pinching the poodle, "you positively shan't
read the paper. I want you to talk to me and
Hector."</p>

<p>"What about?" asked Sir John, still half
frowning. Theodora went up close to him and
standing on tip-toe, with one arm yet around the
poodle, leaned forward and putting two rosy fingers
under her husband's chin said coquettishly:</p>

<p>"About that closet over yonder, where people
say you keep your murdered wives. Don't we,
Hector?"</p>

<p>"Yap! yap!" went the poodle.</p>

<p>The change that came over Sir John's face at
these words was indescribable. He started to his
feet, his face black with rage, his eyes flaming as
he seized Theodora violently by the arm.</p>

<p>"How dare you?" he yelled, almost frothing at
the mouth.</p>

<p>"How dare I?" asked Theodora, carefully putting
the poodle in Sir John's vacant chair. "Now,
keep quiet, Hector. Because I want to know and
I'm going to find out."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very well," answered Sir John, recovering his
self-possession. But his cold fury was worse than
his hot anger. A woman less intrepid than Theodora
would have sunk under the appalling glare of
his eye. "Listen, then, and I will tell you. But
first put down that infernal dog."</p>

<p>Theodora had seated herself with Hector in her
lap, but she thought it wisest to let him go, as it
was a case where force could be used to her disadvantage.
"Just wait a minute," she said briskly.
"It's his bed-time, anyway. I'll ring for James,"
and suiting the action to the words, she went forward
and rung the bell like a church warden.</p>

<p>James appeared in a twinkling, and Theodora
confided the poodle to his care with many injunctions.
Then she returned to her seat.</p>

<p>"Now, madam, I will begin."</p>

<p>"Do," said Theodora pleasantly. "I'm dying
to hear."</p>

<p>"You shall be gratified," answered Sir John
darkly. "My first wife was thought to be a very
amiable and attractive woman. We lived happily
together until her indiscreet curiosity&mdash;mark well
my words&mdash;about that closet, caused her to try the
lock with a chisel. The chisel slipped and cut an
artery. She was found weltering in her blood."</p>

<p>"How awkward!" exclaimed Theodora, spreading
her handkerchief out in her lap, and examining
it as if she had never seen it before. "Of course
I mean how awkward for you."</p>

<p>"It was a great deal more awkward for her,"
gloomily remarked Sir John&mdash;and continued:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>"My second, was a gifted creature, but she,
too, got the devil in her."</p>

<p>"She must have caught it from&mdash;hem&mdash;!&mdash;hem!"
replied Theodora, coughing gently.</p>

<p>Sir John glowered at her and kept on. "She,
too, longed to see the inside of the closet. Her
curiosity&mdash;do you hear me, madam?&mdash;kept her
awake, and she spent her nights wandering about
the house. One night she missed a step at the top
of the stairs and broke her neck. There was no
one but myself in the house except the servants."</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" cried Theodora. "How
frightened you must have been!"</p>

<p>"My third&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;Fatima&mdash;my latest predecessor&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, there was an absurd rumor at the time
of Fatima's death&mdash;she, too, died of curiosity&mdash;that
I had been killed by her brothers. Of course
the truth came out after a number of unpleasant
things had been printed about me. My Uncle Longacre
advised me to sue the papers for libel. And
now, madam," he said with a malignant smile, "do
you still wish to see the closet?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do!" cried Theodora jumping up
with the greatest alacrity. "Now more than ever,
since it is the remote cause that I am Lady Blood
and will one day be Marchioness of Longacre.
Come, hurry up with the key."</p>

<p>Sir John gazed at her with a sort of stupefied
amazement.</p>

<p>"Rash girl!" he cried. "Do you know what
you ask?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perfectly," answered Theodora, coming up to
him and holding out a little jeweled hand, "Give
me the key."</p>

<p>"Great Heavens!" shouted Sir John, "this is
intolerable. God forgive me for marrying an
American! I will never marry another. I shall
have to silence her as I did Fatima."</p>

<p>"Give me the key, <i>you old goose</i>!" screamed
Theodora in his face, and shaking his arm violently.</p>

<p>At that instant their eyes met. Sir John's were
blazing with anger, while in Theodora's there
shone a fire that&mdash;no, it could not be&mdash;yes, yes, it
was&mdash;that made something like fear come into
Sir John's handsome devilish face. She tightened
her grip on his arm, and occasionally jerked it up
and down to emphasize her remarks, while she
cried:</p>

<p>"I want that key. You may well say" (shaking
his arm furiously) "that you'll never marry
another American girl. You'll never have the
chance" (shake, shake). "When I married you I
was willing to love you, just as Anne does that
Scotch angel of hers, but I am not going to put
up with your hectoring ways like poor Fatima."
(Shake.) "You thought I'd be afraid of you&mdash;ha!
ha! I'm an American girl, you great booby. Don't
look at me in that way" (shake, shake, shake),
"but give me the key this instant, or I'll order the
carriage and drive to the nearest magistrate and
denounce you on your own confession!" (Shake,
with variations.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir John's countenance during this tirade was a
study. At first a furious, helpless rage, then over-powering
amazement, followed by a hideous fear,
and at last an abject, helpless, hysterical breaking
down. He fell on his knees at Theodora's feet,
clutching her gown, and bursting out into wild
lamentations, he screamed:</p>

<p>"Spare me! Spare me!"</p>

<p>"The key," panted Theodora, with a relentless
smile on her beautiful sensitive mouth. The miserable
man feeling in his trousers' pocket produced
a key&mdash;with the identical blood stain on it left by
poor Fatima.</p>

<p>"Now," said Theodora, letting him go and transferring
the key to her pocket, "I don't want to see
in the closet&mdash;no doubt it is a horrid place&mdash;but
I shall keep hold of this and see that you don't get
it again."</p>

<p>Her contemptuous tone aroused a faint spark
of the spirit that made the worm turn. He called
up all his coward's courage, and, rising to his feet,
said sullenly:</p>

<p>"All is not yet over between us."</p>

<p>"Do go away," replied Theodora scornfully.
"You bore me to death with your heroics. But I
think you've found out now what it is to be married
to an American girl. It's like a mustard plaster&mdash;wholesome,
if not pleasant, and not to be ignored."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some months after this a large party was assembled
at Castle Longacre, for Sir John Blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
was Marquis of Longacre, and she who was once
Theodora March was now Theodora, Marchioness
of Longacre. Mrs. Wodehouse was of the party,
and so was Anne, now Mrs. William McBean, and
sweeter, prettier, and gentler than ever. Not so
gentle was she, however, that anybody dared to
offer her any commiseration on account of her
long-legged lieutenant, for at the first hint of the
kind she showed fight so unmistakably, that even
Theodora was fain to desist. Anne esteemed William
as the first man in the world. With a refined
and noble arrogance she conveyed to the world
her pride and satisfaction in being the choice of
such a man&mdash;and from being the meekest and most
lamb-like of girls, developed into a person of considerable
spirit, fully determined to sustain the
honor of being William McBean's wife. She was
not only openly and candidly and deeply in love
with her lieutenant, whose strong sense and firm
character were but dimly obscured by his red head
and his hard features, but she loved the whole clan
of McBean, was a rampant Jacobite, and went in
for tartans, cairngorms, bag-pipes, Flora McDonald,
Highland Mary, etc., with an ardor truly
American. Meanwhile, as Anne became more determinedly
Scotch, William McBean, who was a
reading fellow, showed a strong leaning toward
America and republicanism. Thus they were supplied
with something to squabble about&mdash;lacking
which, steady matrimony is apt to become a little
tedious, it is said.</p>

<p>The first evening after dinner, before the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
had come up from the dining-room, the ladies gathered
around the drawing-room fire, and about the
piano. "Dear Theodora," said Mrs. Wodehouse,
going up to her and taking her hand, "How
proud I am of you! When you went into dinner
on the Prince's arm, you never looked lovelier.
Nobody would ever have imagined that you had
not been born a marchioness."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Theodora with a brilliant smile.
"You see, here there are only a few marchionesses,
but with us we are all marchionesses in our own
esteem."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Mrs. Wodehouse meditatively,
"you American peeresses certainly are&mdash;er&mdash;a&mdash;remarkable
lot&mdash;all of you seem to have been born
in the purple, and every one I've seen yet is a red-hot
Tory."</p>

<p>"<i>That</i> I am," cried Theodora playfully, stamping
her pretty foot. "I believe in my Order, as
Ouida calls it, the more because it's all new and
delightful."</p>

<p>"And a&mdash;your husband seems a charming
man," continued Mrs. Wodehouse a little timidly.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Theodora heartily. "We've agreed
to let by-gones be by-gones. He's thoroughly domesticated."</p>

<p>Just then occurred the little flutter that announces
an irruption from the lower regions. A
number of men came in at once, the marquis and
William McBean among them. Six months of his
American wife had aged the marquis ten years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
His hair was whitened and his once bold eyes had
a cowed and uneasy look.</p>

<p>The talk ran to hunting. The marquis said:
"To-morrow the Marsh meadow is to be drawn,
and I can promise you as good sport as is to be
found in the country. There is an old red fox&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dearest," cried Theodora, softly but reproachfully,
from her sofa, "if you go out to-morrow
how are you to finish painting the front of my satin
gown which I am to wear at the hunt ball?"</p>

<p>Everybody had heard her. William McBean
grinned delightedly, and whispered to Anne, "Now
the British lion's tail will be twisted."</p>

<p>The marquis's face grew three quarters of a
yard long. He shifted uneasily in his chair.</p>

<p>"My love, do you really want that gown?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do, darling."</p>

<p>"Then," said the miserable marquis, with a
ghastly assumption of a joke, "I'll have to give up
the Marsh meadow to-morrow. But the next day,
Wednesday&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;oh!" cried Theodora with coquettish
playfulness, pinching his ear, "don't you know
you've got to take mamma up to town to do some
shopping? Forgetful man!"</p>

<p>"I really had forgotten," exclaimed the poor
marquis, turning very red, "I'm glad you reminded
me, my dear."</p>

<p>"And Friday's the day you promised to take
Hector to have his picture taken. I couldn't think
of trusting my precious poodle to a heartless footman."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>"Quite true," said the marquis, turning pale,
"but Saturday, my pet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Saturday!" exclaimed Theodora, "I have no
end of things for you to do, dearest. I want you
to fetch Major Philibeg over from the barracks in
your trap, and Sunday you must go to church, you
know, dear love."</p>

<p>"Certainly, my own," meekly responded the
once redoubtable man who had killed three wives.
At this William McBean suddenly darted out of
the room, and was found half an hour afterward
haw-hawing in the smoking-room. The spectacle
of the British lion with his tail between his legs
seemed to afford William rapturous amusement.</p>

<p>The Marsh meadow was drawn the next day,
but the marquis, transformed from a lion into a
lamb, was not among the huntsmen. After performing
all of Theodora's errands, he was allowed,
as a treat, a game of tennis with the chaplain of
the castle&mdash;for this young American marchioness
not only had her private chaplain, but would have
had her private archbishop if she could have had
her way, so naturally did she take to her privileged
class. She "my loved" and "my deared" the
marquis at a great rate, but Hercules spinning flax
was a picture of manliness alongside of him.
Anne's kind heart disposed her to take his part
somewhat, but William McBean, who chuckled incessantly
at the state of affairs, encouraged Theodora
to lay on like Macduff. The marquis was
made to wear goloshes whenever he went out, his
cigars were docked, and at midnight, just as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
fun grew fast and furious in the smoking-room,
Theodora's own footman would tap at the door,
and the marquis, with a feeble pretense of "coming
back after a while" would disappear. He
never came back though. William McBean, who
was the life and soul of the smoking-room, would
make this hypocritical promise of the marquis's
return an excuse for keeping up a rollicking good
time until unearthly hours of the morning, when
the last cigar would be smoked, the last story told,
the last punch brewed.</p>

<p>Wherever Theodora moved she was accompanied
by a suite, consisting of the marquis, the
chaplain, the footman, and the poodle&mdash;and of
these, the one most under her thumb was the once
terrible Sir John Blood, whom his own mother
would scarcely have recognized, so wonderfully
had his American wife changed, or as Theodora
expressed it, reformed him.</p>

<p>On the Sunday, a respectable contingent was
mustered for service in the castle chapel. The
marquis complained of a cold, but was nevertheless
present at both morning and evening service, by
the side of Theodora, who had her poodle on the
other side.</p>

<p>Toward twilight Mrs. Wodehouse peeped into
the little morning room used by Theodora. By
the dusky light she saw her seated at the cottage
piano. She was playing chords softly, while the
poor marquis, sitting by her with his throat wrapped
up in flannels was warbling in a hoarse voice but
with much piety:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"A consecrated cross I'd bear."</p>

<p>Mrs. Wodehouse raised her hands in a paroxysm
of silent surprise.</p>

<p>"A consecrated cross he'd bear!" she exclaimed
presently, in a whisper. "Well he's got it&mdash;he's
got an American wife!"</p>

<h2 id="FIDDLER">TUBAL THE FIDDLER.</h2></div>


<p>"You ain' never hearn 'bout we-all's Tubal?
I thought ev'ybody in de State uv Virginny had
done heah 'bout Tubal de fiddler."</p>

<p>Outside the cabin door the sun of May shone
bright, beautiful, intoxicating. The old negro held
his ragged hat in his lap, and sat on the corner of
the bench that caught the full glare of the sun, unvexed
by the dappled shadows of the black-leaved
poplars.</p>

<p>"Tubal he <i>wuz</i> a fiddler, Gord A'mighty knows.
Nobody never did know how he learn ter play de
fiddle. Hit mus' er come ter him natchel, like de
way de bees sing in clover time, 'kase one day ole
marse gone ter git he fiddle outen de case, an'
'twarn't d'yar! You jes' oughter heah ole marse
sw'ar! He allers could cuss an' sw'ar like a gentmun;
an' ef he didn't f'yar smoke, an' sizzle dat
day dis nigger is a liar. All day long ole marse
he r'ar an' pitch. But when de han's come in at
sundown, Yaller Josh, de hade man, he brung
Tubal 'long to'des de house. Josh he hol' little
Tubal by de collar, an' Tubal he walk 'long, playin'
de fiddle, an' he never stop. Josh he haul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Tubal up 'fo' ole marse, settin' on de po'ch, an' it
tu'n out dat little coon Tubal had been settin'
'hine de straw-stacks all day long learnin' ter play
on ole marse's fiddle! He had done tooken it!
He had acshilly done tooken it! 'Fo' ole marse
could git he bref ter bawl out, Tubal he say,
"Marster, please, sir; jes' listen, sir;" an' he strike
up 'Forked Deer,' an he play de same ez any
morkin<sup>[1]</sup> singin'. Old marse he jes' set d'yar an'
st'yar at de boy. Den Tubal he teched up 'Snowbird
on de Ashbank,' an' he 'gin ter shuffle he
foots on de po'ch, while ole marse he beat de flo'
wid he stick; but when Tubal come ter play 'Kiss
me sweetly,' he back-step all de time he playin' it;
an' fust thing we all see ole marse he jump up an'
start ter footin' it, doin' de back-step, double-shuffle,
cut de pigeon wing, an' ev'ything&mdash;he an'
Tubal jes' dancin' a reg'lar breakdown twell de
po'ch rattle."</p>



<p class="i7"><sup>[1]</sup> Mocking-bird.</p>

<p>"'Twuz a sight, I tell you, wid Tubal sawin' de
bow, an' he an' ole marse, bofe on 'em, whackin'
de groun'. Den ole marse he tooken de fiddle an'
<i>he</i> play, an Tubal <i>he</i> dance, an' d'yar dey wuz!"</p>

<p>"Arter dat, ole marse buy Tubal a fiddle fer
hisse'f, an' Tubal he never do no mo' wuk, 'scusin'
'twas wid de fiddle an de bow. He never wuk in
de crap. He make 'tense he wait in de house; but
Unc' Daniel, dat wuz de dinin'-room servant, he
say Tubal warn' no more use ter him dan de fiddle
wuz. In dem times, 'fo' de cullud folks wuz free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
an' enlightenment, 'twarn' counted no sin fer ter
play on de fiddle. Now de niggers know de devil
iz a fiddler, an', consequenchical, de chu'ch members
doan' play on nuttin', 'cep' 'tis de 'corjion. But
ez fer 'ligion, Tubal he didn' have none. Oncet
when ev'y nigger on de Shelter plantation was
seekin' 'cep' Tubal, ole marse he beller, "You kin
all git jes' ez much 'ligion ez you kin tote, but ef
I cotch dat fiddlin' Tubal seekin' an' cryin' an'
prayin', I lay I'll wallop de Gorspel outen him 'fo' he
know it, genteel an' quick." An' he would, too
But Tubal warn't a seeker, er even a backslider.
Den de white folks in de county got ter sen'in' fer
him ter play at de parties, an' ole marse he gin him
a ole jinny mule dat th'o' ev'ybody dat ever did
try to ride her. Tubal he sot on dat jinny mule
jes' a hol'in' on by he knees, wid he fiddle under he
chin, an' he play 'Billy in de Lowgrounds' fer
life. Jinny didn' know what ter make er dat;
so she ciphered it out, an' say ter herse'f: 'Dis
heah nigger mus' be Kun'l Boswell's Tubal. Tain't
wuff while ter wrastle wid dat nigger.' An' she
didn'. Ole marse he wuz a widower, an' he had done
los' bofe he chillen, but he had two gran'sons&mdash;Marse
Jack Boswell an' Marse Page Carter&mdash;dat
live at de Shelter, an' wuz gwi' git all ole marse lan'
an' niggers. I doan' know how 'twuz, but Tubal an'
all de black folks got de notion dat he wuz gwi'
b'long ter Marse Page when ole marse die an' de
niggers wuz 'vided out. Tubal sut'ny did love
Marse Page, an' track him same like a dog. Dey
allers got in mischief toge'er; an' Marse Page take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
a whuppin' fer hisse'f, but he allers try an' baig
Tubal off.</p>

<p>"Ole marse he wuz mighty cur'us 'bout some
things. He want jes' three hunderd niggers&mdash;no
mo' 'n' no less. Sometimes de black folks teck ter
dyin', an' he git down ter two hunderd an' ninety
odd. Ole marse he groan an' moan, an' say he
c'yarn wuk de Shelter plantation wid less'n three
hunderd niggers, an' ef dey keep on dyin' in dis
infernal discontemptuous way, he gwi' be a bankrup'.
Den, fust thing, de black babies would come
like de blackberries on de bushes, an' may be he
have three hunderd an' fifteen. Den ole marse
would cuss twell you see de brimstone in de a'r, an'
say dat de Shelter place c'yarn' s'pport mo' 'n three
hunderd niggers nohow, an' ef dey keep on gittin'
born, de owdacious niggers would ruin him.</p>

<p>"He wuz allers gwi' co'tin, but he never did.
He say de plantation want a mistis an' somebody
ter look arter de two boys; but he couldn' go
co'tin' in summer, 'kase he had ter go to de
Springs; an' in de fall, wid de sellin' uv de craps,
an' de fallowin' fer wheat, an' de 'lection, he didn'
have no time; an' in de winter he had de rheumertiz;
an' he 'low dat co'tin' never did 'gree wid him
in de spring uv de year. Miss Patty Corbin she
wait fer him fo'teen year, an' den she sen' him
word 'twuz den er never. Ole marse he sen her
back word 'twuz never, 'kase he didn't like ter be
hurried in he 'rangements. So he didn' never got
married; an' when he die he jes' leave all he property
ter be 'vided out 'tween Marse Jack an' Marse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Page, 'cep he lef' Marse Page he silver watch. Ole
marse tho't a sight er dat watch. He wouldn'
never let no watchmaker tech it, fer he feerd he
mought spile it; an' when it got wrong he jes'
take a feather an' some lard an' grease it hisse'f,
an' den 'twuz all right ag'in.</p>

<p>"Well, all de black folks like Marse Page de
bes', an' all on 'em want ter 'long ter him. Marse
Jack he mighty quarrelsome an' 'sputifyin' 'bout
things, an' he say he want Tubal de fiddler. Tubal
he fall down on he knees 'fo' Marse Page an' baig
dat Marse Page take him; but Marse Page he had
done ask fer Mam' Betsy&mdash;dat wuz de mammy uv
bofe de boys&mdash;an' Marse Jack say he 'titled ter
Tubal. Marse Page he offer ter buy Tubal right
outen; but Marse Jack say no, Tubal wuz de bes'
fiddler in de county, an' <i>he</i> want him. So Tubal had
ter go wid Marse Jack; but Tubal he say to we-all,
mighty solemn like: 'Marse Jack think he gwi'
git a fust-class fiddler. I sw'ar I ain' never gwi'
draw dat bow ez long ez I is Marse Jack's nigger.
I done sw'ar it, an' I done make a cross in de
ashes 'fo' I sw'ar.'</p>

<p>"Naix thing we heah, Marse Jack he gwi' move
ter de upper country, whar dey doan' have no
oshters er crabs er nuttin' fer ter eat&mdash;an' sho'
'nuff 'twuz so.</p>

<p>"I never will furgit de day dey all lef'. Dey
wuz wagons fur all de women an' de chillen an' de
sick folks an' de ole folks, an' de men dey walk.
Tubal wuz d'yar on de jinny mule, but he didn'
have no fiddle. Marse Page come ter tell 'em<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
good-by. De black folks cry an' pray an' sing,
same like 'twuz a baptizin', 'twell Marse Page he
tooken out he white hankercher an' he cry too.
Tubal he hol' on ter Marse Page, an' ax Gord ter
bless him, an' ax him if he 'member when dey
useter go fishin' toge'er, an' Marse Page t'yar he
Sunday jacket, so Mam' Betsy have ter give it ter
Tubal&mdash;he allus like brass buttons&mdash;an' Marse
Page tell him he ain' never gwi' furgit he faithful
Tubal, an' lars' thing Tubal say ter we-all er-cryin'
wuz, 'I ain' gwi' tech dat fiddle, I ain' gwi' tech
dat bow, ez long ez I b'long ter Marse Jack Boswell.'
An' he didn'.</p>

<p>"De years an' de years pass on. We done hear
dat Marse Jack he try ter make Tubal play when
he got him up de country, but Tubal he doan'
play. Marse Jack den put him in de corn fiel', an'
Tubal he han's jes' es sof' ez Marse Jack's hisse'f;
he have ter hoe de row, but he doan' play de fiddle.
Marse Jack he tell him ef he will play de
fiddle he kin hire out ter play at de parties, an'
make a heap uv money. Tubal he 'low steadfas'
he ain' never gwi' play no mo'. But de niggers
say dat in de night-time Tubal he git up an' go
'way in de woods, whar he had done hide de fiddle,
an' he play twell mos' mornin'. De folks gwi'
'long thu' de woods moonlight nights hear de
soun's floatin' by, an' dey git skeered an' run, an'
say 'tis evils 'broad; but nobody never tole Marse
Jack. He an' Marse Page didn' have nuttin' 'tall
ter do wid each ur'r arter dey fell out 'bout Tubal.
Bofe on 'em got married, an' Marse Page wife die<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
soon, an' lef' him er little gal. She growed up
mighty pretty, wid gray eyes, sorter like partridge
eyes, an' she wuz slim an' slight. Marse Page he
live on at de Shelter, but he warn't like ole marse.
He wuz sof' spoken, an' he read books, an he
never talk 'bout goin' co'tin' no mo', an' he wuz de
best marster in de county. He wuz mighty fond
o' Miss Letty, an' useter say, 'Dat little gray-eyed
gal <i>she</i> got er sperrit.'</p>

<p>"Well, arter a while de war broke out at de
Norf, an' Marse Page he raise a cump'ny an'
went ter de war. He sont Miss Letty off ter
school, an' de niggers jes' stay on de plantation an'
work under de overseer. But it didn't seem like
nuttin' prosper no mo'. De craps warn' no 'count&mdash;de
wheat allers had de rus' an' de corn warn'
nuttin' but nubbins, an' de line fence cotch fire an'
bu'n up mos' all de fencin' on de place, an' a storm
come an' to' down mo'n half de house; an' when
Marse Page an' Miss Letty come back arter de
war, de niggers wuz free, an't' wasn' nuttin lef'
but de lan'. But Marse Page wuz a gent'mun, an'
he couldn' live no way 'cep' de quality way, an'
co'se he had ter borry money fer ter do it; 'sides
dat, he had done los' he right arm in de war. So
fer a year er two things wuz putty much like dey
wuz 'fo' de war; Miss Letty had her piany an' her
hoss, an' marse he cigars an' he silk stockin's an'
sech.</p>

<p>"One de fust things dat happen arter de war
wuz one day when Marse Page wuz settin' on de
po'ch in ole marse' cheer. He look up, an' d'yar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
stan'in' on de gravel parf, wuz a ole man on a jinny
mule, an' he had er fiddle under he arm, an' widout
sayin' er word he 'gin ter tune up dat fiddle, an' he
start ter play 'Kiss me sweetly.' Marse Page he
sot right still, an' de tears rain down he face, an'
den de nigger man he hop off'n de jinny mule, an'
he come up de steps, an' he say, 'Marse Page, I is
a free man now, an' I come fer ter be yo' nigger
oncet mo'.'</p>

<p>"Marse Page he call out fer Miss Letty, an' she
come flyin', an' fo' her par could say a word she
say, 'Why, it's Uncle Tubal.' She ain't never seen
Tubal, but she hearn 'bout him; and den he kiss
her little han', an' Marse Page had he liquor case
fotch out, an' he an' Tubal drink ter ole times, an'
Tubal he f'yar make de fiddle talk. Arterward
Tubal he go right back in he ole house he had
lived in ole marse' time. Tubal didn't have no
wife er chillen; he say he fiddle were all de wife he
want; an' he go back ter de ole ways. No mo'
hoein' an' wukkin' for Tubal; he jes' sot an' play
de fiddle all day.</p>

<p>"Dis heah way went on fer a while, an' mout
er gone on twell now, but all de po' white trash
dat Marse Page had intrusted wid de mortgage on
de Shelter 'speck him ter pay de money back, an'
co'se Marse Page didn't have it; ef he had had it,
he wouldn' er borried de money nohow. An', ef
you will b'lieve dis nigger, dem low-down white
folks make Marse Page pay all he debts fur ez he
could, an' de place wuz sol', an' de black folks went
off, an' Marse Page an' Miss Letty had ter go an'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
live in de overseer's house. It didn't have but fo'
rooms. Tubal he went wid 'em, an' he wuk de bes'
he kin, but Tubal warn' no wukker, natchel. Marse
Page couldn' do nuttin', 'kase he didn't have but
one arm, an' bimeby times got wuss an' wusser, an'
hard an' harder, an' Miss Letty&mdash;she had a fine
eddication&mdash;she had ter go 'way an' teach school,
an' leave Tubal ter take keer uv Marse Page.</p>

<p>"Now Tubal he useter hoe in de g'yardin an'
keep things goin', but de onlies' way he could git
money wuz by fiddlin'. Marse Page he do widout
all he could, but he wuz er gent'mun, an' he couldn'
do widout much, an' Miss Letty she sent him all
she make. An' den one night he wuz tooken sick
an' had a stroke of paradise. He couldn' move, an'
he couldn' hardly talk, but he call Tubal ter de
baidside, an' he say, 'Remember, boy, not a word
of this to your Miss Letty.' You see, Marse Page
didn' have no right arm, an' he couldn' wrote wid
he lef', an' Tubal had 'rections fum Miss Letty dat
ev'y week he wuz ter git somebody ter write ter
her an' tell her 'bout Marse Page, an' she keep on
sen'in' him her money, but dat wouldn' been 'nough
arter Marse Page got he stroke of paradise, ef it
hadn' been fer Tubal's fiddlin'. Now, in dem
times, dey wuz Yankees 'bout. Dey wuz two or
three cump'nies dat camp out at de river landin',
an' Tubal useter go over ter de camp an' play fer
'em, an' come back wid er greenback in he pocket.
Marse Page by dat time didn' know nuttin' hardly.
He jes' lay d'yar an' suffer an' groan. Out at de
camp dey wuz a orficer&mdash;a cap'n&mdash;dat wuz mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
gin'rous ter Tubal, an' Tubal ax him ef he write a
letter fer him ter Miss Letty. De cap'n 'gree, an'
ev'y week Tubal go over an' git dat cap'n ter write.
He warn' so ole, an' he were a gent'mun as wuz a
gent'mun, ef he didn' have no niggers 'fo' de war,
an' had ter have low-down white folks ter black he
boots an' bresh he close. All de time Tubal wuz
tellin' de cap'n what ter write, de cap'n wuz larfin'
ter hisse'f, an' pres'ny he look kinder pitiful. Tubal's
letters wuz mighty cur'us. Fust he tell de cap'n ter
write dat all de quality in de county come ev'y day
ter 'quire arter Marse Page. 'Twuz a lie, an' Tubal
say so. 'Co'se dat's a lie, cap'n,' he say. 'Seem like
de quality folks has clean forgot how Marse Page
useter live at de Shelter 'fo' de war, wid thirty hosses
in de stalls, an' cum'p'ny all de time, an' champagne
like water outen de spring. But I c'yarn let
Miss Letty know dat.' Den he tell him ter wrote
Marse Page wuz so spry, an' he so intrusted in her
letters, an' didn' want no mo' uv her money; an'
ev'ybody know Marse Page 'ain' been able ter read
hardly sence Miss Letty went away. De cap'n
wroten it all, an' he gin Tubal a greenback mos'
ev'y time he see him, an' sen' Marse Page some
brandy like he been useter, an' tell Tubal ef he
want nuttin' ter come ter him.</p>

<p>"One night de cap'n wuz settin' in he tent
readin', an' Tubal sneak in, lookin' sorter queer.
He say in a whisper: 'Cap'n, Marse Page is 'mos'
gone. He callin' fer Miss Letty, an' you mus'
wrote Miss Letty fer me, an' tell her, fer Gord
A'mighty's sake, ter come home ez quick ez she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
kin.' De cap'n he wroten it right away, an' he tole
her all 'bout de boats, an' how she wuz ter make
corrections wid de k'yars, an' could git here by
Sad'day. An' Tubal he never lef' Marse Page night
er day.</p>

<p>"Well, dat naix Friday night, when de boat stop
at de landin', off step Miss Letty: she had done
make de corrections, an' got here 'fo' dey speck her.
'Twarn't nobody at de wharf ter meet her, but
de cap'n wuz d'yar wid he orderly, an' when he see
Miss Letty so pale an' pretty an' distrussful, he
went up to her an' injuced hisse'f, an' ax ef he
could be uv any resistance ter her. Miss Letty she
toss her hade, an' look him all over wid dem
gray eyes o' hern; she didn't like no sort o' Yankees,
an' he had he uniform on; but he was so polite an'
respectious, an' he hol' he cap in he han' all de
time, dat pres'ny Miss Letty kinder softened. An'
when he tole her he had done wroten de letters for
Tubal, an' he hope she doan' fin' her father ez bad
ez she 'spected ter fin' him, Miss Letty jes' broke
down, an' cry fit ter break her heart. De cap'n
tu'n away, an' didn' notice her twell she had got
th'u' cryin', an' den he come back an' bow like a
gent'mun, an' tole her he mus' take keer on her
home, dat he horse 'ain' never had de honor uv
kyar'in' a lady, but he know she ain' 'feerd, and kin
ride on he army saddle. Den Miss Letty smile a

but Miss Letty she sot him, an' de cap'n he smile,

<p>"'Twuz fo' miles ter de overseer's house, an'
when de cap'n lef' her at de do', he tell her de camp
warn' mo'n harf mile away, an' ef she want any
help, he hope she would treat 'em like frien's 'stid
uv enemies, an' Miss Letty she promise she would.</p>

<p>"Marse Page didn't live a week arter Miss Letty
got d'yar. She found out dat de quality folks had
sorter neglec' him, an' she was so proud and haughtical
she wouldn' sen' fer none on 'em; an' Tubal
say he doan' know what she would er done ef it

say no, she thank 'em; dey couldn' do nuttin' 'tall.
De funeral wuz mons'ous big. Miss Letty she walk

'hine Miss Letty. De cap'n wuz d'yar too.</p>

<p>"Miss Letty, arter de buryin', she settle down

wid de cap'n's compliments, an' sometimes he sen'
her er basket er grapes or er bokay. Miss Letty
she wroten him er little note an' ax him ter come

Tubal say it discomfuse him ter have Miss Letty
seein' cump'ny in dat d'yar ole overseer's house,
but she wuz fust quality, jes' de same ez ef she wuz

Miss Letty fer receivin' Yankee orficers.</p>

<p>"'De bes' people in de county doan' countenance

<p>"'Very well,' answer Miss Letty, wid her cheeks
afire, 'it seems they didn't countenance my poor
father much after he left the Shelter, but this Yankee
orficer <i>he</i> countenance my father when he was
ill an' poor an' want frien's&mdash;and, Miss Patty,' she
say wid her eyes blazin', 'it's a subject I won't have
mentioned to me again&mdash;please understand&mdash;an' I
wish you good-morning.' Miss Patty she flounce
out ter her gre't big kerridge in a huff, an' Miss
Letty she walk back inter de overseer's house like
it wuz a palace, an' she wuz a queen.</p>

<p>"Tubal he meet de cap'n on de road dat very

<p>"Arter chu'ch, 'stid o' folks stoppin' ter speak

Miss Letty she say, 'Yes, and a great deal more.'
Ef you will believe dis nigger, Miss Letty she
marry dat cap'n! She did, fer a fac'! She married
him, sartin an' sho! She marry him 'fo' de

c'yarn leave Marse Page all by hisse'f in de graveyard,
an' ef he could jes' live on at de overseer's

all right. Miss Letty fix fer him ter stay, an' de'
wuz a little g'yarden patch fer him; but Tubal he
warn' never no 'count ter wuk; he wuz too much
uv a artis', de cap'n say. So arter dey wuz married
an' gone, Tubal useter take he fiddle an' go
an' set in de sun by Marse Page grave, an' play ter
him, an' dat nigger had de s'prisin' owdaciousness
ter play hymn tunes on de fiddle, like 'Roll, Jor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>dan,

fer hisse'f, he say, but de reels an' jigs wuz fer
Marse Page, 'kase he allers like dat sort o' music.
An' it seem ter me like Tubal play mo' like de birds
ev'y day; when he play a reel, it wuz like de win'

todes winter Tubal cotch de rheumatiz, an' he
couldn't git outen de house, an' he finger-j'ints got

<h2 id="PRISCILLA">PRISCILLA.</h2></div>


<p>Priscilla's beauty was of that shadowy and
spiritual kind that it took a good while to find out
that she was a beauty at all. Certainly Priscilla's
sisters, the Misses Mildmay, had sublime faith in
Priscilla's charms; but the poor girl herself had
spent so much of her twenty-five years of life trying
to conform to the standard of behavior inculcated
in the Misses Mildmay's boarding and day
school for young ladies and little girls that it had
robbed her of that delicious and ingenuous vanity
which is the glorious inheritance of pretty young
things of her gender. The Misses Mildmay lived
in an imposing four-story brick mansion in a street
of the sternest respectability; there was not a suspicion
of the shop in the stately front door, and
the heavily draped windows bore no advertising
sign. The tall man-servant who opened the door
was loftily oblivious to the pupils who sneaked in
by the garden way. The Misses Mildmay had
made money in their school&mdash;and it was all for
Priscilla. Had this youngest birdling in the dove-cote
been like her elder sisters, nothing could have
been better contrived than the scheme of happi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>ness
proposed to her. But unfortunately Priscilla
was no more a Mildmay than she was a Montmorency
or a Condé. It is true that she conformed
outwardly to the Mildmay model, but Nature's
original Priscilla was a merry, fiery young creature
with peachy cheeks and a perpetual smile and a
good appetite. All these things, however, were
kept in abeyance&mdash;particularly her color and her
appetite. Had that dignified footman been cut up
into juicy chops for Priscilla's breakfast, and that
mahogany door been made into rich soups for
Priscilla's dinner, she would no doubt have lost
some of that pretty pallor, that pathetic look out
of her dark eyes. But the income of the Misses
Mildmay did not admit of the footman and the
mahogany door and the juicy chops and rich soups
too, so they skimped on the dinners, skimped on
the amusements, skimped on all those vanities that
had never had any charms for them, but which
Mother Nature, who is obstinate as well as perverse,
had meant for the younger sister.</p>

<p>The Mildmay religion was necessarily of a well-bred
and repressive type; but Priscilla was given
to getting up early and walking long distances to
a church in East Harrowby, where not one single
person could be found who might be called "in
society" except Priscilla herself. The clergyman,
it is true, was a gentleman, but he was said to be
so cold, so stern, so unsocial, that he strongly repelled
his own class. There was, however, a reason
for the Rev. Mr. Thorburn's indifference to general
society. He had met with the most awful of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
domestic calamities. The wife whom he loved had
lost her mind, and was then in a private asylum.
The only shifting of his burden that the stern Mr.
Thorburn showed was, he had given up the charge
which he had held for ten years, and where his happy
married life had been spent, and had taken a very
small and pitifully poor church in East Harrowby.
His congregation was made up entirely of working
people, to Mr. Thorburn's intense satisfaction.
He had the spirit of an apostle, but he was handicapped
by his temperament and by the traditions
of his class. He could not be persistent, or aggressive,
or personally solicitous about the highly educated,
moral, and well-bred persons who made up
his first congregation. He desired earnestly and
even fiercely to wake them up to a spiritual life,
but all of them, pastor as well as people, were too
well bred for that sort of intimate discussion to be
forced between them. He found, after some years'
experience, that they were willing to let him look
after their morals, but they proposed to look after
their spiritual affairs themselves&mdash;which is one of
the commonest and queerest developments of modern
religious thought.</p>

<p>In the course of time, Thorburn grew weary of
trying to spiritualize a congregation of people who
were so well off in this world that they regarded
their probable transposition to heaven with great
distaste. He sickened of being restricted in his
spiritual efforts to emotional women and priggish
boys and girls. Religion, he felt, was an affair for
men&mdash;but of the few men communicants in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
church, every one of them would have instantly
withdrawn his subscription and quitted the church
had the clergyman showed any undue solicitude
about his soul. And if he had ventured to speak
of their sins, in any except the most general way,
the bishop would have come down upon him. So
this zealous man, so cruelly misplaced, found his
fashionable congregation and handsome salary utterly
unendurable after that frightful and heart-breaking
tragedy in his life. He was glad enough
for the chance to preach to a congregation of decent
brick makers, such as made up most of the
population of East Harrowby, and who did not find
this world so pleasant that they could not grasp
the idea of a better one.</p>

<p>Dr. Sunbury, the rector of the handsome stone
church in West Harrowby, was a good man, but he
would have cut a poor figure as an apostle alongside
of that independent citizen, Paul of Tarsus, or Peter
the fisherman. The doctor had the kindest heart,
though, and the most liberal mind in West Harrowby,
and having early had a safe and easy path
to heaven pointed out to him, he had walked along
it for forty years, never doubting that he would
get there in the end. It is true that the spectacle
of Mr. Thorburn, going night and day among his
poor parishioners, being doctor, nurse, adviser, everything
to them, sometimes gave the excellent old
doctor a qualm, but he had sense enough to see
that, even if he wished to follow the same life as the
Rev. Mr. Thorburn, he couldn't do it. There were
no sick, poor, ignorant people in the well-bred, well-fed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
congregation that listened to Dr. Sunbury's
mild and strictly general exhortations.</p>

<p>Priscilla Mildmay alone of all the doctor's flock
went after the new parson at East Harrowby and
his shabby, uncomfortable church. But Priscilla
always had an odd way with her, so her elder sisters
gently lamented. For example, instead of
reading the religious flapdoodle with which they
were quite satisfied, Priscilla would devour her
Thomas à Kempis as if all of truth was to be found
therein, and declared she could not read anything
after that except the four Gospels. The Misses
Mildmay had not failed to report Priscilla's iniquity
to Dr. Sunbury, but they got cold comfort.</p>

<p>"Let the girl alone," he said. "Thorburn's a
better preacher than I am, and, God knows, he is a
better man" (the doctor possessed, without knowing
it, one of the greatest Christian' virtues&mdash;humility)
"and don't bother her. She is right. I'd
go to hear Thorburn myself if I didn't have to
preach." The two clergymen were upon the most
friendly terms, although so widely apart in every
respect but that of mutual good-will. The only
house in West Harrowby that Thorburn visited
was Dr. Sunbury's and the old doctor trudged over
to East Harrowby sometimes, to smoke a pipe of
peace in Thorburn's dingy lodgings. Dr. Sunbury
hated walking, but he could not find it in his
conscience to drive over to that woe-begone community
in his snug brougham&mdash;all of which the recording
angel put down in his favor.</p>

<p>Priscilla's face had not escaped Thorburn's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
notice. He had keen eyes, and he saw everything.
He saw Priscilla with wonder. Women, as a rule,
did not flock to his church. They said they found
his sermons cold. Men, and some of them none
of the best, chiefly made up his audiences. It was
not hard anywhere to observe Priscilla's snow-drop
face in her little black bonnet, with her eager,
beseeching eyes. After a while Mr. Thorburn
began to feel their mesmeric influence, as Dr. Sunbury
had done ever since she was fifteen. He began
to watch for her, to preach at her, to feel that
she understood him&mdash;a very comfortable thing for
a public speaker. Of course he knew who Miss
Priscilla Mildmay was&mdash;"Very nice, but not the
equal of the elder Misses Mildmay," he usually
heard&mdash;and sometimes they had met at Dr. Sunbury's.
As Mr. Thorburn was naturally a silent
man, and Priscilla lacked courage in a drawing-room,
they scarcely exchanged half a dozen words.
It came about, though, as these things will, that in
the course of his parish work he came upon Priscilla&mdash;Priscilla
teaching a class of ragged boys their
lessons, after having taught the most stylish young
ladies in West Harrowby the most elegant branches
of a polite education. Some way, all the restraint
they had felt in Dr. Sunbury's drawing-room melted
away in the little bare school room. There
Priscilla reigned supreme, calmly confident under
Mr. Thorburn's searching gaze. She had a peculiar
knack of teaching. Her gentle, "Now, please,
boys," had the same effect as Mr. Thorburn's stern,
"See, you fellows, behave yourselves." Mr. Thor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>burn
watched with admiration the tact with which
she managed her somewhat unruly crowd.</p>

<p>Of course all this teaching did not go on with
the unqualified approbation of the Misses Mildmay.
Priscilla showed a phenomenal determination about
it, and being upheld by Dr. Sunbury, who in some
way always encouraged her vagaries, the Misses
Mildmay, although they might look coldly on it,
could not forbid it.</p>

<p>It did not take much to violently excite West
Harrowby; and therefore when the Harrowby
Union-Palladium published one morning, with a big
display head that covered half the first page of the
paper, the burning of the Northern Lunatic Asylum,
a certain circumstance connected therewith
gave West Harrowby something to talk about for
a week. Five inmates of the women's ward were
missing, and among them was Mrs. Eleanor Thorburn.
Five bodies, charred beyond recognition,
were found in the ruins. Some days after a notice
appeared in the obituary column of the Union-Palladium:
"Suddenly, on the 17th of February, Mrs.
Eleanor Thorburn, wife of the Reverend Edmund
Thorburn, of East Harrowby." That was all.</p>

<p>Nobody&mdash;not the most censorious&mdash;could accuse
Mr. Thorburn of not paying scrupulous respect
to his wife's memory. Yet it made but little
outward difference in his life. For two or three
Sundays he was absent from his pulpit, and when he
reappeared he wore a band of crape upon his hat.</p>

<p>So things went on until nearly two years had
slipped past. One spring afternoon Dr. Sunbury,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
with his particular chum and crony, Dr. Forman,
the great light of the medical profession in and
about Harrowby, was enjoying a quiet saunter
through the familiar shady street. They had
wrestled in argument so often, and practiced in
company so much, that Dr. Sunbury had become a
pretty good doctor of medicine, and Dr. Forman
was no mean proficient in theology. Right in the
midst of a friendly-fierce wrangle on the subject
of ecclesiastical history, Dr. Forman suddenly remarked,
"That's going to be a match."</p>

<p>Dr. Sunbury glanced up, and saw Mr. Thorburn,
as he met Priscilla Mildmay, stop, smile,
speak a few words, and, lifting his hat, go upon
his way.</p>

<p>"Bless my soul!" almost shouted Dr. Sunbury,
stopping short and gazing at Dr. Forman's immovable
face.</p>

<p>"Why not?" said the doctor testily. "I see
them together half a dozen times a week."</p>

<p>Dr. Sunbury was at heart an inveterate matchmaker,
as all truly benevolent old persons are apt
to be, and as soon as he allowed his imagination
to feast upon the idea of a match between Thorburn
and Priscilla, its manifest fitness impressed
itself so upon him that he would fain have got out
a license, gone to them, and commanded them to
stand up and be married immediately. He did,
however, firmly resolve to give Thorburn a hint;
but giving Thorburn hints was always a matter of
more or less difficulty with everybody. At last,
however, the opportunity came, and Dr. Sunbury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
seized it courageously. He had been spending the
evening with Mr. Thorburn at his lodgings, and
the other clergyman happening to mention, as Dr.
Sunbury was taking his leave, that he thought of
getting lodgings elsewhere, Dr. Sunbury remarked
quite naturally that he "had heard something regarding
Mr. Thorburn and Miss Priscilla Mildmay
which perhaps accounted for the proposed change."
They were standing at Mr. Thorburn's door, and
by the bright moonlight Dr. Sunbury saw the dark
flush which overspread Mr. Thorburn's somewhat
saturnine face.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I assure you&mdash;" he began; and then, after
a pause, "I am too old."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" replied Dr. Sunbury. "Priscilla
is nearly twenty-six" (ah! doctor, you know she
was only twenty-five month before last), "and you
are&mdash;let me see&mdash;thirty-seven."</p>

<p>"Thirty-nine," conscientiously said Mr. Thorburn.</p>

<p>"Well, thirty-nine. You are enough man of
the world to see that age interposes no obstacle in
the case. However, I shall say no more. Good-night."</p>

<p>"If I hadn't been going just then, I don't think
I could have said it," confidentially remarked Dr.
Sunbury to Dr. Forman.</p>

<p>The little seed that Dr. Sunbury had planted in
Mr. Thorburn's mind grew, and waxed to be a
great tree. But all the time he looked upon it as
impossible. Priscilla was but a child, and he was
a man grown old in sorrow, in suffering, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
labor. No, it could never be. And having come
to the conclusion that he was in no danger whatever,
Mr. Thorburn fared just as such presumptuous
Samsons always do. He met Priscilla under
the most adverse circumstances, running home
from a shower, and in a manner the most unexpected
to himself, proposed to her just as they
came in front of the West Harrowby savings-bank,
which was also the post-office and the principal
apothecary's shop. Priscilla's behavior was
of a piece with his own. The idea had never been
presented to her mind before, and it was a matter
that required the utmost circumspection in deciding,
and yet by the time she reached her own door
she had accepted Mr. Thorburn, the rain meanwhile
from his umbrella trickling in little rivers
down her back. There was neither time nor opportunity
for love-making in the midst of a pouring
shower, upon the pavement in front of the
Mildmay mansion, so Mr. Thorburn could only
take her little cold hand and say, "God bless you,
God bless you, my Priscilla!"</p>

<p>In due course of time the wedding&mdash;a very
quiet one&mdash;came off, and Mr. and Mrs. Thorburn
were settled in a modest rectory in East Harrowby.
The Misses Mildmay had suggested&mdash;indeed, urged&mdash;that
Mr. Thorburn should establish his rectory
in the more fashionable precinct of West Harrowby,
but Mr. Thorburn demurred, on the ground of
its being a clergyman's duty to live in his parish.</p>

<p>They were as happy as the day was long. Priscilla,
under the new influence of happiness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
good roast beef and a daily pint of porter, grew
rosy, and blossomed out into a regular beauty, and
Mr. Thorburn's face lost that painful expression it
had been wont to wear when he strode through the
streets on his parish work. And time went by so
fast&mdash;so fast; they had been married nearly three
years, when they felt as if their honey-moon was
just beginning.</p>

<p>It was getting toward dusk one misty November
afternoon when Priscilla went tripping past
Dr. Forman's house, which stood on the opposite
side of the street. The moisture from the over-hanging
branches of the elm trees was dripping upon
her, and her boots were quite soaked through.
Across the way the doctor was just stepping out of
his buggy, and she stopped and debated whether
she should not go over and ask him to drive her a
quarter of a mile further down the road to the rectory.
As she stood hesitating, a woman approached
her out of the mist, and spoke.</p>

<p>"May I inquire," she said, "the way to the
house of the Rev. Mr. Thorburn?"</p>

<p>She was perhaps forty, and had once been
pretty. Even now a certain pathetic charm attached
to her, and the voice and accent were of
that cultivated kind which established her title to
be called a lady, in spite of the extreme plainness
of her attire.</p>

<p>Her hair, which was a beautiful auburn, curled
over her forehead in little natural rings, and her eyes
were strangely bright. She looked as if she had
just recovered from illness, and was not physically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
strong, but there was a look of tremulous happiness
in her face. When she said "the Rev. Mr.
Thorburn," her voice was musically lowered, and
her gray eyes became radiant. Priscilla took all
this in at a glance. She was some woman whom
Thorburn had befriended, and who had come to
him to lay down her load of gratitude at his feet.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Priscilla, with ready politeness;
"just down the road, the first house to the left.
You will have to wait an hour or two, perhaps,
though, for Mr. Thorburn. He is seldom in before
half past-six. I am Mrs. Thorburn, you see," she
said, smiling.</p>

<p>The stranger looked at her for a moment with
a kind of wide-eyed horror, and, throwing her arms
up in the air, fell prone on the ground as if she had
received a pistol shot through the heart.</p>

<p>Priscilla had never been brought face to face
with any startling emergencies during her quiet
life. She stood for a moment frozen with terror,
and then ran like a deer across to where Dr. Forman
stood giving some directions to his man.</p>

<p>"Oh, doctor, come! run as fast as you can."
She pointed to the prostrate figure lying in the
muddy road. Dr. Forman gave one glance, and
started at a smart pace, Priscilla keeping up with
him, and telling him breathlessly what had occurred.
The doctor bent down, turned the unfortunate
woman over on her back, and said two
words, "Dead faint."</p>

<p>"Can't I do something?" said Priscilla, hovering
near.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
"Yes. Go and tell Sam to come here at once,
and then go home yourself. You'll have another
touch of rheumatism if you go out in this weather.
I shall speak to Thorburn about it."</p>

<p>The doctor was a man of authority; so Priscilla,
after sending Sam over, and returning only
to be sharply ordered about her business, went
home. Mr. Thorburn was later than usual that
night. A strike was threatened among the brick
makers, and they had said they would treat with
him and with no one else. He was troubled and
harassed&mdash;and, contrary to the custom of some
women in like circumstances, Priscilla did not
choose grewsome stories, like strange women fainting
in the street, to entertain him&mdash;so nothing was
said of the somewhat tragic occurrence of the
afternoon. Next morning he was off bright and
early, Priscilla making no mention of her aching
joints. Before night the doctor's promised touch
of rheumatism had set in. Priscilla made light of
it, but agreed to send for Dr. Forman, and insisted
that Thorburn should attend to the business of
averting the strike. Instead of coming himself,
young Dr. Curtis, Dr. Forman's assistant, came.
Dr. Forman had a very ill patient. Mrs. Thorburn
inquired eagerly about the woman who had
dropped in the street. Dr. Curtis had heard Dr.
Forman say something about it, but supposed it
was all right, as he had heard nothing further on
the subject. Mrs. Thorburn would be all right
too if she would stay in the house in bad weather,
and take care of herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
The incident made no very particular impression
on Priscilla. But on the night after it had happened,
Dr. Sunbury got a very pressing message
from Dr. Forman. He went at once to the doctor's
house, picking his way through the dark November
night; and Dr. Forman opened the door himself,
and led the way into his little back office, where he
told his visitor of the patient he had found in the
street, and who at that moment lay up-stairs in the
doctor's spare bedroom, with the doctor's housekeeper
in attendance on her.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;she&mdash;is&mdash;" Dr. Forman hesitated. A
strange pallor was upon his homely, good-natured
face, and his voice was tremulous. He took a moment
or two to recover himself, and then burst out:
"She is&mdash;the first wife of Mr. Thorburn."</p>

<p>Dr. Sunbury rose from his chair and fell back
in it again. He raised his hand as if in denunciation.
"May God&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait. He is as guiltless as you are." Dr.
Forman paused a minute or two, and then took up
the thread of his discourse where he had left off
describing his sending Priscilla Thorburn home.
"I brought her, with my man's help, into the
house, and had her put in bed. It was plainly
nothing but a faint; but she went from one fainting
spell into another, and when I had finally
brought her round, the fainting spell changed into
convulsions. For hours I worked with her. At
last I stopped them, and got her under the influence
of an opiate. I was tired myself, and went
to bed to get a few hours' sleep, leaving word for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Curtis to be called. In the middle of the night I
was waked by Jane standing by my bedside, looking
frightened out of her wits. 'Do, pray, Dr. Forman,
come to the strange lady.' When I got to
the room she was lying in the bed, weak, but perfectly
conscious. She intimated to me that she
wished to say something to me privately. Of
course I tried to induce her to put it off, but she
was determined.</p>

<p>"I saw that she was no ordinary woman&mdash;she
had been beautiful&mdash;and she was still comely.
And she had that air of melancholy command that
those who are in the crisis of tremendous misfortunes
only have. So I sent Jane out of the room.
Then she said, in the calmest possible way, 'Doctor,
I am the first wife of Edmund Thorburn.' I
was incredulous, and thought her crazy, the more
so that the next thing she told was that she had
been for the last six years in a lunatic asylum. But
when she told me her story I saw that she was at
that moment as sane as I was. And such a story!"
Dr. Forman, a stolid man usually, took out his
handkerchief and buried his face in it, and an occasional
sob escaped from him. Dr. Sunbury put
his hand to his eyes, as the doctor gasped out at
intervals. "They were so happy! She had given
up everything to marry him, and wanted him to
give up his parish because it did not suit him, and
to take some such charge as East Harrowby, and
to share his poverty with him&mdash;she, delicately nurtured
and finely bred. And then came the terrible
illness, and a still more terrible blank; and then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
after years which are as nothing in her mind, a return,
an awakening, a resurrection to life and the
most perfect felicity, so she thought&mdash;poor thing,
poor thing!&mdash;and when she got here, to East Harrowby,
she was so overcome with the happiness in
store for them, that she felt her heart would burst
if she saw him too suddenly&mdash;she wandered about,
waiting until dusk to go to his house, and to throw
herself in her husband's arms&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dr. Forman paused for a long time. Then
presently recovering himself, he suddenly fell into
his calm, professional tone.</p>

<p>"No family taint&mdash;violent fever, followed by
more violent insanity, and likely to result in a
cure." After a moment he continued: "She, of
course, remembered nothing of her first attack.
She called it insanity; nothing insane in her way of
speaking of it, using just the same terms you or I
would, without evasion, and supposes now that
from certain faint recollections her cure had begun
about the time of the asylum fire. She remembers
something of the scene, and the next thing
finding herself shivering and half clad in a railway
train. She remembers nothing more until she
became an inmate of the Central Lunatic Asylum.
There were no means of identifying her for a long
time. She had been supplied with clothes by
charitable people on the train. No inquiries were
made about her, which she could not understand
until I told her of her supposed death. She was
called Mrs. March, because it was in the month of
March that she was brought to the asylum. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
recovery was gradual, but it is a common experience
with such persons that their own names and
individuality is the last for the restored mind to
grasp. About six months ago she became perfectly
herself. She felt an entirely sane and rational doubt
of herself, until time had tested it; but about a
month ago she gave such information of herself
as led to a letter being written to Brightwood,
where Thorburn had a church at the time of her
illness. Thorburn was not there, but an answer
was received saying he was at East Harrowby.
They wrote again. That letter could never have
been delivered, and, after waiting four weeks for
an answer, Mrs. Thorburn persuaded the superintendent
to allow her to come here with an attendant
to find her friends. The attendant found some
acquaintances, and began to gossip with them.
Mrs. Thorburn tells me that she felt shame and
horror at returning to her husband's house accompanied
by a keeper; so she slipped off, and met
Priscilla. You know the rest."</p>

<p>Dr. Sunbury sat looking like a man paralyzed.
"Well?"</p>

<p>"You must send Thorburn here to-night."</p>

<p>Dr. Sunbury rose and walked restlessly about
the little office.</p>

<p>"To-night," repeated Dr. Forman; "for I don't
think she'll last beyond to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter with her?" asked Dr.
Sunbury, pausing in his troubled walk.</p>

<p>"Nothing but death," answered Dr. Forman.
"Skill can do nothing for that woman. She ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
to have rallied from the fainting spells; instead,
she went off into convulsions. She ought to have
rallied from the convulsions; instead, she is sinking
as fast as any mortal I ever saw. Poor thing,
so pretty, so gentle!"</p>

<p>It was arranged that Mr. Thorburn was to be
sent for; and to Dr. Sunbury was left the dreadful
task of telling him the truth.</p>

<p>An hour after that, Dr. Sunbury, thinking miserably
of poor Priscilla and the unhappy creature
up-stairs, heard the wheels of Dr. Forman's buggy
grinding on the gravel outside, and Mr. Thorburn's
quick, firm step as he entered the house. Dr.
Sunbury met him with a sinking heart, and a cold
tremor that shook him like an aspen.</p>

<p>"I came at once, as you see, my friend," began
Thorburn cheerily. And then looking closer at
Dr. Sunbury's white face, said, "Why, what is the
matter?"</p>

<p>Dr. Sunbury, without a word, led him back
into the little office, and carefully closed the door.
"Thorburn," he said, "I believe you to be a man
and a Christian. Call up, therefore, all your manhood,
and all your dependence on God, to bear
what I have to tell you."</p>

<p>Mr. Thorburn's dark skin grew a shade darker
at these words, but he made no reply, only looking
Dr. Sunbury full in the eye.</p>

<p>"Priscilla told you, perhaps&mdash;of a woman fainting&mdash;in
the road&mdash;Tuesday afternoon," Dr. Sunbury
got his words out in gasps.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
"She is now in this house. Thorburn, she is&mdash;the
wife you supposed dead."</p>

<p>Mr. Thorburn took in as quickly what had been
told him as his dying wife had done. He rose
from his chair; the strong man reeled and fell,
with a deep groan, and his arms outstretched over
the doctor's study table. Dr. Sunbury made no
offer of consolation. He covered his face with
his hands and wept.</p>

<p>After a pause, Thorburn said: "We must do
what is right. My poor Priscilla!"</p>

<p>He suddenly checked himself. Ah, it was but
a little while since he had known Priscilla&mdash;and
the woman up-stairs was the wife of his youth.
And he had loved her well. But which one of us
would rejoice at having the dead to rise from their
graves?</p>

<p>"Will you not see&mdash;" said Dr. Sunbury, after a
short silence, pointing overhead, where the dying
Mrs. Thorburn lay.</p>

<p>"Now? Not yet, not yet. Give me a moment,
for God's sake."</p>

<p>"But she is dying; she has not long that she
can wait for you."</p>

<p>Thorburn rose at once. "Tell me how it was,
before I see her," he asked.</p>

<p>In a few words Dr. Sunbury told him.</p>

<p>Just then Dr. Forman appeared. "You had
best go now," he said to Thorburn.</p>

<p>Dr. Sunbury took Mr. Thorburn's arm and led
him up-stairs. Dr. Forman preceded them. As
they reached the door, Thorburn caught Dr. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>man's
wrist, his face quite ashy and his eyes wild,
as if to ask for a moment's grace; but it was too
late, the door was open, and Dr. Forman had beckoned
to the nurse to leave the bedside. Thorburn
closed the door after him, and walking to the bed,
found himself alone with the woman that to him
had risen from the dead.</p>

<p>"Forgive me! Forgive me!" was all that
Thorburn could say.</p>

<p>"Forgive you?" asked the wife, in her old
sweet voice. "Why should I not forgive you?
Only, you must pity me. Think! six years of
agony, to return and find&mdash;I thought until now
that it was easier to die than live," she continued,
feebly. "It would save so much misery if death
should free you from me."</p>

<p>"Eleanor! Eleanor!"</p>

<p>"And in one moment&mdash;in the twinkling of an
eye, I was dashed from the most perfect happiness
into the most terrible misery. I thought my home
was waiting for me; I thought my husband's heart
yearned for me&mdash;and without one word of warning&mdash;I
beheld myself an outcast on the face of the
earth&mdash;a being whose death would bless the man
she loved!"</p>

<p>Her voice grew strong in its intensity as she
spoke. Thorburn leaned on the bed, his arm
around her, and great drops upon his pallid face.
A groan burst from him. The dying can not weep,
but there was a terrible and piercing pity for herself
and for him in Mrs. Thorburn's uncertain voice
and her misty eyes. Thorburn tried to tell her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
that he had not forgotten her&mdash;that he loved her
when he thought her dead&mdash;but it was only half
expressed, and Mrs. Thorburn checked him gently.</p>

<p>"We have only a little while to be together,"
she said. "I felt myself to be dying the instant I
felt myself to be alive. I have been dying for three
days&mdash;and I tried to die without seeing you&mdash;but I
could not&mdash;I could not!"</p>

<p>Down-stairs Dr. Sunbury and Dr. Forman conversed
in whispers, Dr. Forman holding his watch
in his hand. On the stroke of the half-hour he
went up-stairs. As he entered the room he saw
Thorburn half leaning on the bed, while Mrs. Thorburn's
head rested on his breast. The doctor took
one keen look at his patient, and suddenly whipping
out his lancet, called, loudly:</p>

<p>"Jane! Jane! come at once. I want to give
Mrs. Thorburn a hypoderm of brandy."</p>

<p>Dr. Sunbury heard the call, and came too. He
obeyed a look from the doctor, and taking Thorburn
by the arm, almost dragged him from the
room. Jane came with the brandy, with salts, with
the doctor's electrical appliances; but it was too
late. Mrs. Thorburn breathed an hour or two
longer, and then, without a word, a look, or a sigh,
stopped breathing.</p>

<p>"It is all over," said Dr. Forman, going out on
the landing to speak to Dr. Sunbury.</p>

<p>Thorburn went away the night of his wife's
death.</p>

<p>To Dr. Sunbury was intrusted the terrible task
of telling Priscilla. He came forth from that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>terview
ten years older, and tottering as he
walked.</p>

<p>The affair was hushed up, and the world at
large was no wiser about it. Thorburn and Priscilla
left East Harrowby, ostensibly on account of
Thorburn's breaking down. Before they left, a
marriage ceremony, the most painful that could be
imagined, was performed between them in Dr. Sunbury's
study, with Dr. Forman for a witness.</p>

<p>But never afterward were Thorburn and Priscilla
happy. They were good, they loved each
other, they were thrown upon each other for comfort&mdash;but
between them sat the ghost of the dead
woman, who had come to claim her happiness, and
found another woman in possession of it.</p>

<h2 id="KAINTUCK">KAINTUCK.</h2></div>


<p>The sergeant's ruddy, handsome face was the
only cheerful object within the prison yard as he
walked up and down, crossing the sentry's beat.
The yard was small&mdash;it was at the back of the
gloomy brick building&mdash;and only one narrow window
looked out upon it. The day was dark and
dull. The soldier marching up and down, clutching
his musket, looked sulky and cold, and he wondered
why a man like Sergeant Heywood, who
didn't have to do sentry duty, should be pacing
back and forth for two hours at a stretch.</p>

<p>The sight of a prisoner's face at the barred
window did not add to the cheerfulness of the surroundings.
The face was curiously twisted and
distorted by a shot that had torn through the jaw.
It would have been repulsive but for the eyes&mdash;eyes
pathetic, curious, patient, almost the color of
the faded "butternut" clothes of the prisoner.
As soon as the sergeant saw the poor face at the
window he halted in his walk, and called out,
cheerily, "Hello, Kaintuck!"</p>

<p>"Hello!" responded Kaintuck, with equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
cheeriness, but in a thin, soft voice, such as might
be expected to come out of his narrow chest.</p>

<p>"How are you to-day?" continued the sergeant.</p>

<p>"Purty well, considerin'," answered Kaintuck.
"Las' night I didn't sleep very well. This here
old jaw got to achin'; an', by golly, sergeant, she
kin everlastin' ache when she starts in! Ef it
hadn't ben for that terbacker you give me yesterday,
I'll 'low I'd had a sorter onpleasant time.
But it was a comfort, cert'n'y. Before I lit my
pipe it seemed like I never was goin' ter see Polly
an' the kid no more, that you blarsted Yankees
was a-goin' ter whip us, spite o' General Lee, an'
that this here jaw was a-goin' ter come all ter
pieces. But I hadn't hardly lighted that pipe, sir,
before I seen Polly an' the kid right before me,
lookin' peart an' gay, an' Marse Bob had done
licked you all like the devil, an' my jaw was all
right, an' goin' ter stay so. That's what terbacker
does for a man."</p>

<p>The sergeant accepted these indications of the
prisoner's sympathies with great good-humor.</p>

<p>"I've got some more of that same brand," said
he; "it affects me kinder the same way too.
When I smoke, it seems to me General Grant is
marchin' into Richmond, and the bands is playin'
'Yankee Doodle,' and I'm a colonel ridin' at the
head of my regiment."</p>

<p>Kaintuck smiled at this. His smile was a mere
contortion, but his deep strange eyes smiled luminously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>"I reckon it's a kinder universal comforter.
Did it bring your wife and your kids right up
before you?"</p>

<p>The sergeant was a great strapping fellow, six
feet high; but at this pleasantry he blushed like a
girl.</p>

<p>"I ain't got a wife, nor kids either; but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You've got a girl, hain't you? Come, sergeant,
let's hear 'bout it. It's mighty lonesome
somehow in this Government hotel."</p>

<p>The sergeant laughed, and came closer to the
window. Just then a streak of sunlight fell upon
him, as he stood with one foot advanced and his
stalwart arms crossed; but the prison window and
Kaintuck remained in the gloom. The sergeant
pulled his cap down over his eyes quite bashfully,
and cleared his throat.</p>

<p>"Now, I'm talking confidential, Kaintuck&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An' you don't want me to tell the agreeable
an' amusin' companions I have in here," continued
Kaintuck, in the same soft, slow voice. "Fac' is,
when a man's been in prison fur eighteen months,
an' never had a soul but them doctors ter take no
more notice of him ner a dog, excep' yourself, sergeant&mdash;"</p>

<p>Kaintuck stopped. The retrospect struck him
unpleasantly.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm goin' to tell you what I ain't told
even to my folks at home. I've got a girl&mdash;an'
she's only twenty-one years old, an' a widder&mdash;an'
the biggest rebel, b'gosh&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sergeant brought all this out in jerks, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>termingled
with suppressed laughter; and when
he announced the last fact, Kaintuck joined in his
hilarity.</p>

<p>"Blamed if women ain't the queerest lot," remarked
Kaintuck, chuckling.</p>

<p>"You bet," assented the sergeant, still laughing.
"You oughter heard that gal sass me.
There she was, all by herself in a little house, with
a kid about two years old, an' when I come politely
to tell her I'd take care the men didn't milk
her cow or take her chickens, and told her she
needn't be afraid of anything, she stood in her
door, with that baby in her arms, and fairly poured
hot shot into me. 'I'm a soldier's widow,' she
says, her eyes blazing. 'Do you think I know
what it is to be afraid of <i>you</i>? Oh, if this child
only was a man to shoulder his dead father's musket!'
Now, you know, Kaintuck, that kind o'
talk from a poor young thing all dressed in black
breaks a man all up. So I just kep' my cap in my
hand, and I says, 'Madam, I respect a soldier's
widow, no matter which side the soldier fought on,
and whether you'll agree or not, I'll make it my
business to see that you'll have some kind of protection.'
We was in winter quarters then, about a
mile from her house. You know, men is hard to
manage sometimes, and if I hadn't spoke to some
of the officers, the poor thing's little all in the way
of chickens and such would have gone. But I
told my cap'n about it, and that her husband was
killed in the rebel army, and he settled it so that
not a man dared to be seen near that hen roost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
and cow pasture. But I don't know what she'd 'a
done for wood if I hadn't looked out for her. I'd
drop an armful, and knock at the door, and she'd
open it. Then I'd say, 'Will you please to tell me
where to put this?' 'Anywhere you like,' she'd
say, and go on with her knittin' an' sewin'. It
kinder nettled me at first, but she looked so young
and pitiful, I couldn't get mad with her. Then
somehow that young one got almighty fond of me.
Every time I'd pass by that little house&mdash;and I got
to goin' by purty often&mdash;he'd come toddlin' out&mdash;he
was a handsome youngster&mdash;and he'd howl like
tarnation if I didn't take him up in my arms. At
first his mother&mdash;her name's Mary&mdash;would look
black at me; but one day the little feller took my
cap out of my hand, and tried to put it on his own
head. 'No, sir,' says I. 'The lady yonder'll
think you're poisoned if you put a blue cap on
your head.' At that she laughed. I never seen
her laugh before."</p>

<p>Kaintuck had pressed his face close to the bars
of the window to hear the sergeant's story by this
time, and the sergeant had advanced a step or two
so that they could talk in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Go on," said Kaintuck. "How did you git
the better of her at last?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered the sergeant, pulling
his cap down a little farther yet, and showing his
white teeth in a smile. "First time I told her she
was pretty&mdash;by George!"</p>

<p>The sergeant stopped short, completely overcome
by the recollection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>"Kaintuck, she don't more'n come up to my
shoulder, an' she weighs about a hundred pounds,
but I thought she was going to whip me then and
there. I've been scared nearly to death two or
three times during this unpleasantness, but I swear,
Kaintuck, if that little widder wasn't the first rebel
that started me on the dead run, without makin'
some sort of a show of fightin'. However, I felt
so mean about showing the white feather that I
just determined I wasn't going to be stampeded
that way again. So I braced up, an' put on my
best uniform, an' went to see her again. She says,
'I'm a rebel, and I'm bound to be one always.'
'That's all right,' says I, 'bein' you're nothin' but
a woman, and a mighty little one at that, and
ma'am,' says I, 'this thing's goin' to be decided
without the slightest reference to which side you
are on.' She laughed, and then, without any sort
o' warning, she turned her pretty face to the wall
and begun to cry. After a while I talked to her
sensible like. I says, 'Here you are alone and unprotected.
How are you going to bring up that
boy? What'll you do when I go away?' She
turned white, and held the child in her arms. I
said, 'I'll not only do for you, but I'll do for the
boy besides. I've got a little money saved up, and
he'll have his share of it. He shan't never know
what it is not to have a father if you'll marry me,
Mary.' So after a while, between crying and kissing
the baby, and looking mournfully at the fire,
she agreed to marry me if I'd wait till the spring,
and in May I'm going to get leave&mdash;my cap'n<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
knows all about it&mdash;and there'll be one rebel less,
I believe, before long, though she does swear she'll
never be anything but a rebel."</p>

<p>"Sergeant," said Kaintuck, "how did she take
the partin'? Since you've been so free, you won't
mind my askin' the question."</p>

<p>The sergeant hesitated, but there was something
so strangely sympathetic in poor Kaintuck's
humid eyes, and in the ghost of a smile that
haunted his patient face, that the sergeant could
not but tell. "She behaved like a little soldier till
the last. I didn't half like her being so brave.
But when she knew she was seein' me for the last
time&mdash;well&mdash;er&mdash;I couldn't exactly tell another
feller. Anyhow, she had been makin' out all along
she was thinkin' about the boy, but I swear I believe
she forgot all about the blessed kid. She
never told me in so many words, but I kinder suspect
she didn't care so much about the dead feller
as she thought. It leaked out in little things, that
he was kind to her, and she wasn't out of her
teens, and I don't believe she was really grown up
until she heard he was dead in prison, and she had
to look out for herself. Howsomever," said the
sergeant, pulling himself together, and laughing
again&mdash;he was a good-natured fellow&mdash;"I've told
you a durned sight of spooney stuff."</p>

<p>"An' I won't mention it to the rats, neither,"
answered Kaintuck.</p>

<p>"It's time for me to be goin'," remarked the
sergeant, with a sudden accession of shamefacedness
following his confidences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I'm thinkin'," called out Kaintuck after
him as he strode away, "that little rebel widder is
goin' to git a mighty good feller for a husband!"</p>

<p>For four or five days the sergeant was too busy
to go near the prison, but one evening at nightfall,
as he was trudging along to his quarters, some one
hailed him. It was the chaplain, a small, meek
man, as brave as a lion. He and the sergeant had
seen service together.</p>

<p>"Is that Sergeant Heywood?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered the sergeant, touching his
cap.</p>

<p>"There's a poor fellow down at the jail"&mdash;everybody
called Kaintuck a poor fellow&mdash;"who
has been asking for you. He's going to die, I
think."</p>

<p>The sergeant started. Who ever bestowed
kindness and care on a prisoner that did not come
to love him finally? "Why, sir?" asked the sergeant,
after a pause. "What's the matter with
him, sir?"</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;but death. He is rather an extraordinary
fellow. His determination to live brought
him through enough to kill ten men. A day or two
ago he got a letter, and since then he seems equally
determined to die. These cases are not so uncommon,
after all. Did you never hear how easily
a great strapping Russian soldier dies of homesickness
or disappointment&mdash;any little thing that
takes away the desire of living?"</p>

<p>"May be it's the Russian doctors, sir," replied
the sergeant quite gravely. Fear of shot and shell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
he knew not, but he had been seen to turn pale at
the sight of the surgeon's scalpel, and to have
crawled out to parade with a shaking ague on him
rather than encounter a visit from that same surgeon.</p>

<p>The chaplain smiled. "It's not the doctors this
time, though Heaven knows I fear some of these
army surgeons myself."</p>

<p>"I didn't think you was afraid of anything, sir,
after that day at Cedar Mountain, when the officers
kep' ordering you to the rear, and you wouldn't
budge a peg."</p>

<p>A faint color crept into the chaplain's sallow
face. This humble and unstudied tribute pleased
him.</p>

<p>The sergeant was a strict disciplinarian, and
knew better than to stand too long talking with
his officer, so he touched his cap and moved on.</p>

<p>When he reached the prison, it was already
dark. He walked through the long corridor until
he reached Kaintuck's cell, in which a lamp&mdash;a
rare luxury&mdash;was burning. To the sergeant's surprise,
Kaintuck was up and dressed and sitting on
the narrow bed. On his knees was a large new
Bible which the chaplain had given him, but which
he was not reading. His strange eyes were fixed
on the door, and when the sergeant's big figure
filled up the doorway, something like joy flashed
into his maimed face. He got up and shuffled
over to meet the sergeant.</p>

<p>"Why, sergeant," he cried, "I thought you had
forgot me!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, I ain't forgot you," answered the sergeant
kindly; "but the chaplain told me you was
goin' to give us the slip. You don't look like it,
though."</p>

<p>The shadow of a smile showed itself in Kaintuck's
eyes. He had a sort of primitive humor
that delighted in surprises. "Well, I am," he remarked,
after a moment; "I feel it. I felt it the
minute I got&mdash;her letter." Something in his slow
soft tone struck the sergeant and stopped the protest
on his lips. Kaintuck's life had hung on a
thread for the best part of two years, and since he
continued to live with great obstinacy in spite of
the doctors, he might now die in defiance of them.
"I'll tell you," he said, coming up closer to the
sergeant and speaking in a distressed and hurried
voice; "I ain't told none of 'em&mdash;not even the
preacher, and he is a good man if he <i>is</i> a preacher.
You see, Mary&mdash;that's her name&mdash;I just called her
Polly for a nickname&mdash;she's heard down in Jo
Daviess County, Kaintucky, that I warn't dead,
and she wrote me a letter sayin' she was comin' to
me as soon as she was able&mdash;for the news kinder
upset her, and she always was one of the high-strung
kind&mdash;and she's goin' to bring my boy&mdash;he's
named William, and that's my name&mdash;but, sergeant&mdash;"</p>

<p>Kaintuck seized the sergeant's arm and gripped
it hard. Meanwhile at the mention of Jo Daviess
County the sergeant had turned a little pale, and
he grew paler and paler as Kaintuck kept on.</p>

<p>"Sergeant, I read that letter. It was the duti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>fulest
letter a woman ever wrote. But&mdash;but&mdash;don't
you know a woman can marry a feller, an'
be dutiful an' patient, an' all the time her heart's
on fire an' eatin' itself away in grief 'cause she's
married the wrong feller?" He paused a moment,
and then broke out desperately: "And
that's the way with Mary. She wasn't but seventeen
when I married her. She was too young&mdash;she
didn't know. An' here I am a mock an' a
misery. I ain't fit to earn a livin' for her. She'll
faint dead away when she sees this here." He
struck his disfigured face savagely, and did not
wince with the pain. "It's better for her, an' God
knows it's better for me to die. After I got that
letter I felt sorter low. The doctors kem in an'
talked about my havin' flutterin's at the heart, an'
givin' me brandy. Did you ever hear o' brandy
curing a broken heart? Sergeant, I tell you I've
got a blow worser'n that bullet that shot my jaw
away. I didn't mean never to let her know I was
alive unless I got cured an' made a man of again,
and&mdash;and&mdash;" Kaintuck dropped weakly down on
the side of the bed. The sergeant then noticed
that he was of a deathly color, and scarcely able
to sit up, much less to stand. But the sergeant
too wore a strange look, and his strong hands
clinched behind his back were trembling.</p>

<p>Kaintuck, fumbling in the breast of his butternut
shirt, produced a little packet done up in
white letter-paper, on which something was written,
and took from it a tress of chestnut hair, soft
and long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>"This writin' is hers," he said, with a curious
accent of pride, "and her hair is as long as this all
over her head&mdash;and wavy."</p>

<p>The sergeant could not read the words because
they danced before his eyes, but he knew the handwriting,
and on his own breast reposed a lock of
hair that matched the one poor Kaintuck showed
with such pride. Kaintuck, in the frenzy of his
suppressed excitement, did not notice the sergeant's
pallor and agitation. He was wrestling
furiously and blindly with his fate.</p>

<p>"Now don't you see," he asked, "why I don't
want her to come? I ain't got long to live.
What's the use o' dragging her through it? An' I
can tell you, sergeant, it would be a heap easier to
die now than before I seen her an' the boy."</p>

<p>The sergeant turned quietly and walked out of
the room. He went down the corridor toward the
window that overlooked the court-yard, where
everything was black but for occasional patches of
moonlight. The grief and horror with which he
was overcome had an added sting of conscience.
He was an unlettered man, and was not used to
arguing morals with himself. He felt oppressed
with guilt at allowing Kaintuck to go to his grave
without knowing how things really were. But
some instinctive common sense restrained him. It
would only add a last cruelty of fate to tell him
that he had been forgotten and supplanted; and
the sergeant, after looking at Kaintuck closely,
had adopted the chaplain's opinion that Kaintuck
was not long for this world. He did not know how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
long he had stood at the window, when he became
calmer, and returned along the corridor. The
lamp was turned up in Kaintuck's cell, and there
were two or three men standing over the bed.</p>

<p>"Sinkin' spells. Doctors workin' with him,"
sententiously remarked the guard to the sergeant,
pausing a moment in his regular tramp.</p>

<p>Every day after that the sergeant came to see
Kaintuck, and every day Kaintuck's face grew
more pinched, and his eyes larger and more pathetic.
The doctors first wheedled, then grew angry
and scolded Kaintuck. Sometimes he would
take the food and medicine prescribed for him, and
again he would not; but all the time he traveled
steadily toward the grave. Occasionally he endured
furious agonies of pain from his wounded
jaw, which had suddenly grown violent again; and
following that he would lie for hours completely free
from pain, and apparently entirely at peace. But
the poor sergeant was never at peace. A trouble,
a shade, that took the form of an accusing spirit,
walked with him all day, and lay down by his side
at night. And if Mary should come! The sergeant's
heart leaped up into his throat at the bare
idea. Nevertheless he haunted the prison and
Kaintuck's cell, even when he was not on duty.
One afternoon, when Kaintuck had been feebler
than usual, sitting by his bed, something like atonement
seemed possible to the sergeant.</p>

<p>"Kaintuck," he said, "may be you're troubled
in your mind about that boy?"</p>

<p>"I ought to be, but I ain't," answered Kain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>tuck,
who shared the delusion of his class that all
humanity should be troubled of many things, and
should cherish grief and coddle sorrow. "I say,
sergeant, that 'ere little sheep-faced preacher has
made me feel different about things. He sets
there where you is settin', an' talks to me kinder
manly. I ain't never been converted"&mdash;here he
blushed&mdash;"but&mdash;but the chaplain he says 'tain't
how we <i>feel</i> so much as how we do. He says God
will take keer of the child, and his mother too, an'
sergeant, I believe it."</p>

<p>The sergeant had a reverent, simple soul, and
lifted his cap from his head as Kaintuck spoke
God's name. "The chaplain's right," he said, putting
his cap back; "and that there same little soft-spoken
chaplain ain't any more afraid of bullets
than General Grant or General Lee. And I've
been thinkin' I'll find that boy of yours, and I'll
do a good part by him."</p>

<p>Kaintuck's eyes glistened. "You'll have an
orphan asylum soon," he said, remembering that
other boy the sergeant had told him he meant to
provide for; at which the tall soldier felt his heart
sink as with guilt and deception. Presently Kaintuck
said:</p>

<p>"I think I'll go to sleep now, sergeant. What
you said about lookin' out for the boy has made
me feel a heap quieter. Just have an eye to him
and his mother once in a while; an', sergeant, I
want him to grow up a honest man; do you hear
that?&mdash;a honest man."</p>

<p>The sergeant went out of the room and down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the jail corridor. No prisoner within its walls felt
more sad and dispirited than he. Down the
wooden stairs he went, and out the door. At the
steps outside was a little one-roomed frame building.
In it at a table always sat a young officer,
who examined the permits of the people who went
in, and to whom the corporal of the guard reported.
As the sergeant passed the open door of
this little room he suddenly caught sight of a
woman's figure clothed in black, standing by the
table. The officer, contrary to his custom, had
risen from his chair, and stood respectfully. The
sergeant could not have moved to save his life.
He heard the young woman's voice, as low and
patient as Kaintuck's:</p>

<p>"I thought, sir, that he was dead. I wouldn't
have forgot him or neglected him for anything. I
came right away from home, 'way down in Jo Daviess
County, as soon as I could."</p>

<p>"You will find him very much changed,
madam," answered the young officer, as deferentially
as if the poor young country woman was
the general's wife. "He has been well attended
to, as he was a quiet and well-behaved prisoner,
and the doctors have worked faithfully with him."</p>

<p>"I know, that, sir," she replied. "Your men
was very good to me when I was alone, and I
thought my husband was dead, and I had nobody
but my child. The cap'n looked out for me,
though I was nothing but a poor woman, and&mdash;some
others&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped suddenly, and the color stole into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
her pallid cheeks, when, looking up, she saw the
sergeant standing white and dazed-looking before
her. She turned a brilliant red, and then, in an
instant, the color dropped out of her face as the
mercury drops down in the tube. The officer
caught her and placed her in the chair from which
he had risen.</p>

<p>"Mary," cried the sergeant, coming forward
and taking her hand, "I didn't know it no more
than you did. Don't look at me that way. Before
God, I never would have deceived you. You
know I ain't written you a line since I found this
out less'n a week ago."</p>

<p>The young officer clapped his cap on his head
and ran out, closing the door after him. He saw
how it was in a moment.</p>

<p>"Mary," said the sergeant again, after a pause,
"don't you believe me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe you," she answered, recovering
herself a little and standing up. She looked so
slight and pale in her black dress that the big sergeant's
heart smote him with pity. "But I don't
think we can see each other any more. I ain't forgetful.
The only thing for me and him to do is to
get back to Jo Daviess County, and for me to tend
and nurse him faithful. That's the only kind o'
peace I look for now. It'll be hard on you, but
men gets over these things better than women."</p>

<p>"Do they?" cried the sergeant roughly and
fiercely. "Do they, I say? I'll get over mine by
trying to get to the front all the time, and hopin'
some rebel bullet'll end everything. For a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
who loves another man's wife has got no place on
earth. He's in hell already." Her wide and
frightened eyes caused the sergeant a pang of
shame at his language and his violence. He hesitated
a minute, and then said hurriedly: "I ask
your pardon. I ask your pardon for all. Good-by,"
and strode out of the little room.</p>

<p>But at the very door he came near running
over the chaplain. The sergeant's strange looks
made the chaplain seize him by the arm, and then
the tall man saw that the little man too was agitated.
His mouth was twitching, and he looked
quite shaken and nervous.</p>

<p>"Do you know Kaintuck is dead?" he said.
"It was rather sudden at the last. I have just
come from his room. He was a good, simple-hearted
fellow, full of love for his wife and child.
He had very strange eyes. They retained their
brightness to the last."</p>

<p>"For God's sake," cried the sergeant, "his
wife's in there!"</p>

<p>The door opened and she came out. She had
not heard anything, and she was about to pass
them both, holding her head down patiently and
deprecatingly. Something in the chaplain's face
stopped her, though&mdash;and she recognized his clerical
attire.</p>

<p>"If you please," she said, "I'm&mdash;I'm going to
my husband."</p>

<p>The chaplain took her hand and led her inside
the prison door, while the sergeant walked rapidly
out of the jail yard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
The widow with her child went back to Jo
Daviess County. They would have fared hardly,
but for some money that came every month addressed
to the child. The widow took it very
thankfully, for they were poor and plain people,
and when the sergeant had told her that he had
promised poor Kaintuck to look out for the boy,
she thought quite naturally and simply that "looking
out" meant wherewith to feed and clothe the
child.</p>

<p>The sergeant did not turn up the next spring,
but the spring after he came to Jo Daviess
County. He was a sergeant still, and wore his
worsted chevrons with a pride as honest as a
major-general wears his stars. The little widow
was not so pale and disheartened as she had been.
The sergeant told her that he had got good quarters
for her, and the boy could go to the company
school, and that a non-commissioned officer's wife
had a good billet&mdash;to all of which the little woman
agreed, and thought it a fine thing to be married
to a great tall sergeant. And soon not only she
and the sergeant quite forgot poor Kaintuck, but
even the little boy grew up to think that the big
kind sergeant was his only father.</p>

<h3>SUMMER READING.</h3>

<p><i>OUTINGS AT ODD TIMES.</i> By <span class="smcap">Charles C. Abbott</span>.
16mo. Cloth, gilt top, $1.25.</p>


<p class="i2">"Dr. Abbott's love and enthusiasm for Nature, and the things and creatures of Nature,
knows no limit. The story they have to tell him is always new, always charming;
and he interprets it with an enthusiasm and eloquence that carry conviction to his
readers."&mdash;<i>Providence Journal.</i></p>

<p class="i2">"A number of short studies of Nature in her outdoor aspects by one who has established
a reputation as a close and sympathetic student and naturalist. He finds
somewhat of interest and beauty in each season, and reveals to less observant eyes
many of the curiosities and wonders of the living world about us."&mdash;<i>Hartford Courant.</i></p>

<p class="i2">"Short essays on outdoor life set in charming shape."&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Times.</i></p>


<p class="p2"><i>THE WHITE MOUNTAINS. A Guide to their
Interpretation.</i> With a Map of the Mountains and Ten Illustrations.
By Rev. <span class="smcap">Julius H. Ward</span>. 12mo. Cloth, gilt top, $1.25.</p>


<p class="i2">Mr. Ward has spent his summer vacations in the White Mountains for several
years, and has entered deeply into their life and meaning. This book is both a guide
to a better knowledge of the White Hills and a souvenir of what one finds in them.
"Nature," says the author, "in these retreats is very coy, and her secrets are only
communicated to those who seek them. The ability to enjoy natural scenery is partly
a gift, but it may be immensely increased by habits of observation."</p>

<p class="i2">"The author is thoroughly in love with his subject, and not less thoroughly acquainted
with it. Though he disclaims intention to write a guide-book, the visitor to
the White Mountains can hardly fail to profit by his picturesque descriptions, hints
about paths and points of view, and abundant suggestions as to times and seasons."&mdash;<i>New
York Tribune.</i></p>


<p class="p2"><i>THE GARDEN'S STORY; or, Pleasures and Trials
of an Amateur Gardener.</i> By <span class="smcap">George H. Ellwanger</span>. With
Head and Tail Pieces by Rhead. 12mo. Cloth, extra, $1.50.</p>


<p class="i2">A literary ramble amid the flowers of the garden, with practical hints upon the cultivation
of plants, and gossipy comments upon the characteristics of favorite flowers.</p>

<p class="i2">"Mr. Ellwanger's instinct rarely errs in matters of taste. He writes out of the fullness
of experimental knowledge, but his knowledge differs from that of many a trained
cultivator in that his skill in garden practice is guided by a refined æsthetic sensibility,
and his appreciation of what is beautiful in nature is healthy, hearty, and catholic. His
record of the garden year as we have said, begins with the earliest violet, and it follows
the season through until the witch-hazel is blossoming on the border of the wintry
woods.... This little book can not fail to give pleasure to all who take a genuine interest
in rural life."&mdash;<i>New York Tribune.</i></p>
